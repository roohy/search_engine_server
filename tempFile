NASA / ESA  image \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nFalse-color imagery of the  Sun , a  G-type main-sequence star , the closest to Earth. \n \n \n A  star  is a  massive , luminous sphere of  plasma  held together by its own  gravity . The nearest star to  Earth  is the  Sun , which is the source of most of the planet's energy. Some other stars are visible from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points due to their immense distance. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into  constellations  and  asterisms , and the brightest stars gained proper names. Extensive  catalogues of stars  have been assembled by astronomers, which provide standardized  star designations . \n For at least a portion of its life, a star shines due to  thermonuclear fusion  of  hydrogen  into  helium  in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then  radiates  into  outer space . Once the hydrogen in the core of a star is nearly exhausted, almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by  stellar nucleosynthesis  during the star's lifetime and, for some stars, by  supernova nucleosynthesis  when it explodes. Near the end of its life, a star can also contain  degenerate matter .  Astronomers  can determine the  mass , age,  metallicity  (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space,  luminosity , and  spectrum  respectively. The total mass of a star is the principal determinant of its  evolution  and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities, known as a  Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram  (H\u2013R diagram), allows the age and evolutionary state of a star to be determined. \n A star's life  begins  with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous  nebula  of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements. Once the stellar core is sufficiently dense, hydrogen becomes steadily converted into helium through nuclear fusion, releasing energy in the process.   [ 1 ]    The remainder of the star's interior carries energy away from the core through a combination of  radiative  and  convective  processes. The star's internal pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own gravity. Once the hydrogen  fuel  at the core is exhausted, a star with at least 0.4 times the mass of the Sun   [ 2 ]    expands to become a  red giant , in some cases fusing heavier  elements  at the core or in shells around the core. The star then evolves into a degenerate form, recycling a portion of its matter into the interstellar environment, where it will contribute to the formation of a new generation of stars with a higher proportion of heavy elements.   [ 3 ]    Meanwhile, the core becomes a  stellar remnant : a  white dwarf , a  neutron star , or (if it is sufficiently massive) a  black hole . \n  Binary  and multi-star systems consist of two or more stars that are gravitationally bound, and generally move around each other in stable  orbits . When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution.   [ 4 ]    Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a  star cluster  or a  galaxy . \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Observation history   \n   2   Designations   \n   3   Units of measurement   \n   4   Formation and evolution  \n \n   4.1   Protostar formation   \n   4.2   Main sequence   \n   4.3   Post-main sequence  \n \n   4.3.1   Massive stars   \n   4.3.2   Collapse   \n \n \n \n \n   5   Distribution   \n   6   Characteristics  \n \n   6.1   Age   \n   6.2   Chemical composition   \n   6.3   Diameter   \n   6.4   Kinematics   \n   6.5   Magnetic field   \n   6.6   Mass   \n   6.7   Rotation   \n   6.8   Temperature   \n \n \n   7   Radiation  \n \n   7.1   Luminosity   \n   7.2   Magnitude   \n \n \n   8   Classification   \n   9   Variable stars   \n   10   Structure   \n   11   Nuclear fusion reaction pathways   \n   12   See also   \n   13   References   \n   14   Further reading   \n   15   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Observation history  \n \n    \n \n     \nPeople have seen patterns in the stars since ancient times.

Lines have been added. \n \n \n Historically, stars have been important to  civilizations  throughout the world. They have been part of  religious  practices and used for  celestial navigation  and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a  heavenly sphere , and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into  constellations  and used them to track the motions of the  planets  and the inferred position of the Sun.   [ 5 ]    The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create  calendars , which could be used to regulate agricultural practices.   [ 7 ]    The  Gregorian calendar , currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a  solar calendar  based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun. \n The oldest accurately dated  star chart  appeared in ancient  Egyptian astronomy  in 1534 BC.   [ 8 ]    The  earliest known star catalogues  were compiled by the ancient  Babylonian astronomers  of  Mesopotamia  in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the  Kassite Period  ( ca.  1531\u20131155 BC).   [ 9 ]    \n The first  star catalogue  in  Greek astronomy  was created by  Aristillus  in approximately 300 BC, with the help of  Timocharis .   [ 10 ]    The star catalog of  Hipparchus  (2nd century BC) included 1020 stars and was used to assemble  Ptolemy 's star catalogue.   [ 11 ]    Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded   nova   (new star).   [ 12 ]    Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy. \n In spite of the apparent immutability of the heavens,  Chinese astronomers  were aware that new stars could appear.   [ 13 ]    In 185 AD, they were the first to observe and write about a  supernova , now known as the  SN 185 .   [ 14 ]    The brightest stellar event in recorded history was the  SN 1006  supernova, which was observed in 1006 and written about by the Egyptian astronomer  Ali ibn Ridwan  and several Chinese astronomers.   [ 15 ]    The  SN 1054  supernova, which gave birth to the  Crab Nebula , was also observed by Chinese and Islamic astronomers.   [ 16 ]      [ 17 ]      [ 18 ]    \n  Medieval Islamic astronomers  gave  Arabic names to many stars  that are still used today, and they invented numerous  astronomical instruments  that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large  observatory  research institutes, mainly for the purpose of producing   Zij   star catalogues.   [ 19 ]    Among these, the   Book of Fixed Stars   (964) was written by the  Persian  astronomer  Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi , who observed a number of stars,  star clusters  (including the  Omicron Velorum  and  Brocchi's Clusters ) and  galaxies  (including the  Andromeda Galaxy ).   [ 20 ]    According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian  polymath  scholar  Abu Rayhan Biruni  described the  Milky Way  galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of  nebulous  stars, and also gave the  latitudes  of various stars during a  lunar eclipse  in 1019.   [ 21 ]    \n According to Josep Puig, the  Andalusian  astronomer  Ibn Bajjah  proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars which almost touched one another and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of  refraction  from sublunary material, citing his observation of the  conjunction  of Jupiter and Mars on 500  AH  (1106/1107 AD) as evidence.   [ 22 ]    Early  European  astronomers such as  Tycho Brahe  identified new stars in the night sky (later termed  novae ), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584  Giordano Bruno  suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have  other planets , possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them,   [ 23 ]    an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient  Greek philosophers ,  Democritus  and  Epicurus ,   [ 24 ]    and by medieval  Islamic cosmologists    [ 25 ]    such as  Fakhr al-Din al-Razi .   [ 26 ]    By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System,  Isaac Newton  suggested that the stars were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian  Richard Bentley .   [ 27 ]    \n The Italian astronomer  Geminiano Montanari  recorded observing variations in luminosity of the star  Algol  in 1667.  Edmond Halley  published the first measurements of the  proper motion  of a pair of nearby \"fixed\" stars, demonstrating that they had changed positions from the time of the ancient  Greek  astronomers  Ptolemy  and  Hipparchus .   [ 23 ]    \n  William Herschel  was the first astronomer to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s, he performed a series of gauges in 600 directions, and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced that the number of stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, in the direction of the  Milky Way   core . His son  John Herschel  repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction.   [ 28 ]    In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form  binary star  systems. \n The science of  stellar spectroscopy  was pioneered by  Joseph von Fraunhofer  and  Angelo Secchi . By comparing the spectra of stars such as  Sirius  to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their  absorption lines \u2014the dark lines in a stellar spectra due to the absorption of specific frequencies by the atmosphere. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into  spectral types .   [ 29 ]    However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by  Annie J. Cannon  during the 1900s. \n \n    \n \n     \nAlpha Centauri A and B over limb of Saturn \n \n \n The first direct measurement of the distance to a star ( 61 Cygni  at 11.4  light-years ) was made in 1838 by  Friedrich Bessel  using the  parallax  technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of the stars in the heavens.   [ 23 ]    Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius, and inferred a hidden companion.  Edward Pickering  discovered the first  spectroscopic binary  in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star  Mizar  in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as  William Struve  and  S. W. Burnham , allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of the  orbital elements . The first solution to the problem of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.   [ 30 ]    The twentieth century saw increasingly rapid advances in the scientific study of stars. The  photograph  became a valuable astronomical tool.  Karl Schwarzschild  discovered that the color of a star, and hence its temperature, could be determined by comparing the  visual magnitude  against the  photographic magnitude . The development of the  photoelectric   photometer  allowed very precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921  Albert A. Michelson  made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an  interferometer  on the  Hooker telescope .   [ 31 ]    \n Important theoretical work on the physical structure of stars occurred during the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1913, the  Hertzsprung-Russell diagram  was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution.  Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin  first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis.   [ 32 ]    The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in  quantum physics . This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.   [ 33 ]    \n With the exception of  supernovae , individual stars have primarily been observed in our  Local Group  of  galaxies ,   [ 34 ]    and especially in the visible part of the  Milky Way  (as demonstrated by the detailed  star catalogues  available for our galaxy).   [ 35 ]    But some stars have been observed in the M100 galaxy of the  Virgo Cluster , about 100 million light years from the Earth.   [ 36 ]    In the  Local Supercluster  it is possible to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the  Local Cluster    [ 37 ]    (see  Cepheids ). However, outside the  Local Supercluster  of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years   [ 38 ]   \u2014ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed. \n  Designations  \n Main articles:  Star designation ,  Astronomical naming conventions , and  Star catalogue  \n The concept of the constellation was known to exist during the  Babylonian  period. Ancient sky watchers imagined that prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the  ecliptic  and these became the basis of  astrology .   [ 39 ]    Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with  Arabic  or  Latin  designations. \n As well as certain constellations and the Sun itself, individual stars have their own  myths .   [ 40 ]    To the  Ancient Greeks , some \"stars\", known as  planets  (Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (plan\u0113t\u0113s), meaning \"wanderer\"), represented various important deities, from which the names of the planets  Mercury ,  Venus ,  Mars ,  Jupiter  and  Saturn  were taken.   [ 40 ]    ( Uranus  and  Neptune  were also  Greek  and  Roman gods , but neither planet was known in Antiquity because of their low brightness. Their names were assigned by later astronomers.) \n Circa 1600, the names of the constellations were used to name the stars in the corresponding regions of the sky. The German astronomer  Johann Bayer  created a series of star maps and applied Greek letters as  designations  to the stars in each constellation. Later a numbering system based on the star's  right ascension  was invented and added to  John Flamsteed 's star catalogue in his book  \"Historia coelestis Britannica\"  (the 1712 edition), whereby this numbering system came to be called   Flamsteed designation   or  Flamsteed numbering .   [ 41 ]      [ 42 ]    \n The only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies is the  International Astronomical Union  (IAU).   [ 43 ]    A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the  British Library  calls an  unregulated   commercial enterprise .   [ 44 ]      [ 45 ]    However, the IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither recognized by the IAU nor used by them.   [ 46 ]    One such star naming company is the  International Star Registry , which, during the 1980s, was accused of  deceptive practice  for making it appear that the assigned name was  official . This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud,   [ 47 ]      [ 48 ]      [ 49 ]      [ 50 ]    and the  New York City Department of Consumer Affairs  issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.   [ 51 ]      [ 52 ]    \n  Units of measurement  \n Although stellar parameters can be expressed in  SI units  or  CGS units , it is often most convenient to express mass, luminosity, and  radii  in solar units, based on the characteristics of the Sun: \n \n \n \n \n  solar mass : \n  M  \u2299  =  1.9891 \u00d7 10 30   kg     [ 53 ]    \n \n \n  solar luminosity : \n  L  \u2299  =  3.827 \u00d7 10 26   watts     [ 53 ]    \n \n \n  solar radius  \n  R  \u2299  =  6.960 \u00d7 10 8   m     [ 54 ]    \n \n \n \n \n Large lengths, such as the radius of a giant star or the  semi-major axis  of a binary star system, are often expressed in terms of the  astronomical unit  (AU)\u2014approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or 93 million miles). \n  Formation and evolution  \n Main article:  Stellar evolution  \n Stars are formed within extended regions of higher density in the  interstellar medium , although the density is still lower than the inside of a  vacuum chamber . These regions are called   molecular clouds   and consist mostly of hydrogen, with about 23\u201328% helium and a few percent heavier elements. One example of such a star-forming region is the  Orion Nebula .   [ 55 ]    As massive stars are formed from molecular clouds, they powerfully illuminate those clouds. They also  ionize  the hydrogen, creating an  H II region . \n All stars spend the majority of their lives as   main sequence  stars , fueled primarily by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium within their cores. However, stars of different masses have markedly different properties at various stages of their lives. The ultimate fate of more massive stars is different from that of less massive stars, as is their  luminosity  and the impact they have on their environment. Therefore, stars are often grouped by mass.  Very low mass stars  with masses below 0.5  solar masses  do not enter the  asymptotic giant branch  (AGB) but evolve directly into white dwarfs.  Low mass stars  (including the Sun) with a mass above about 0.5 and below about 1.8\u20132.2 solar masses (depending on composition) do enter the AGB, where they develop a degenerate helium core.  Intermediate-mass stars  undergo  helium fusion  and develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.  Massive stars  have a minimum mass of 7\u201310 solar masses, but this may be as low as 5\u20136 solar masses. These stars undergo  carbon fusion , with their lives ending in a core-collapse  supernova  explosion.   [ 56 ]    \n  Protostar formation  \n Main article:  Star formation  \n The formation of a star begins with gravitational instability within a molecular cloud, caused by regions of higher density often triggered by shock waves from nearby  supernovae  (massive stellar explosions), the collision of different molecular clouds, or the collision of  galaxies  (as in a  starburst galaxy ). Once a region reaches a sufficient density of matter to satisfy the criteria for  Jeans instability , it begins to collapse under its own gravitational force.   [ 57 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nArtist's conception of the birth of a star within a dense  molecular cloud .  NASA image  \n \n \n As the cloud collapses, individual conglomerations of dense dust and gas form what are known as  Bok globules . As a globule collapses and the density increases, the gravitational energy is converted into heat and the temperature rises. When the protostellar cloud has approximately reached the stable condition of  hydrostatic equilibrium , a  protostar  forms at the core.   [ 58 ]    These  pre\u2013main sequence stars  are often surrounded by a  protoplanetary disk  and powered mainly by the release of gravitational energy. The period of gravitational contraction lasts about 10\u201315 million years. \n Early stars of less than 2 solar masses are called  T Tauri stars , while those with greater mass are  Herbig Ae/Be stars . These newly born stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the  angular momentum  of the collapsing star and result in small patches of nebulosity known as  Herbig\u2013Haro objects .   [ 59 ]      [ 60 ]    These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed.   [ 61 ]    \n Early in their life, T Tauri stars follow the  Hayashi track \u2014they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the  Henyey track . \n  Main sequence  \n Main article:  Main sequence  \n Stars spend about 90% of their lifetime fusing hydrogen into helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the  main sequence  and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero-age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity.   [ 62 ]    The Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40% since it reached the main sequence 4.6 billion (4.6 \u00d7 10 9 ) years ago.   [ 63 ]    \n Every star generates a  stellar wind  of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses 10 \u221214  solar masses every year,   [ 64 ]    or about 0.01% of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose 10 \u22127  to 10 \u22125  solar masses each year, significantly affecting their evolution.   [ 65 ]    Stars that begin with more than 50 solar masses can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence.   [ 66 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nAn example of a  Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram  for a set of stars that includes the Sun (center). (See \"Classification\" below.) \n \n \n The duration that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has to fuse and the rate at which it fuses that fuel, i.e. its initial mass and its luminosity. For the Sun, its life is estimated to be about 10 billion (10 10 ) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short-lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0.25 solar masses, called  red dwarfs , are able to fuse nearly all of their mass as fuel while stars of about 1 solar mass can only use about 10% of their mass as fuel. The combination of their slow fuel consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows stars about 0.25 times the mass of the Sun to last for about one trillion (10 12 ) years according to stellar evolution calculations, while the least-massive hydrogen-fusing stars (0.08 solar masses) will last for about 12 trillion years.   [ 67 ]    At the end of their lives, red dwarfs simply become dimmer and dimmer.   [ 2 ]    However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current  age of the universe  (13.8 billion years), no stars under about 0.85 solar masses   [ 68 ]    are expected to have moved off of the main sequence. \n Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. In astronomy all elements heavier than helium are considered a \"metal\", and the chemical  concentration  of these elements is called the  metallicity . The metallicity can influence the duration that a star will burn its fuel, control the formation of magnetic fields   [ 69 ]    and modify the strength of the stellar wind.   [ 70 ]    Older,  population II  stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time these clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their  atmospheres . \n  Post-main sequence  \n Main article:  Red giant  \n As stars of at least 0.4 solar masses   [ 2 ]    exhaust their supply of hydrogen at their core, their outer layers expand greatly and cool to form a  red giant . In about 5 billion years, when the Sun enters this phase, it will expand to a maximum radius of roughly 1  astronomical unit  (150\u00a0million kilometres), 250 times its present size. As a giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its current mass.   [ 63 ]      [ 71 ]    \n In a red giant of up to 2.25 solar masses, hydrogen fusion proceeds in a shell surrounding the core.   [ 72 ]    Eventually the core is compressed enough to start  helium fusion , and the star now gradually shrinks in radius and its surface temperature increases. For larger stars, the core region transitions directly from fusing hydrogen to fusing helium.   [ 4 ]    \n After the star has consumed the helium at the core, fusion continues in a shell around a hot core of carbon and oxygen. The star then follows an evolutionary path that parallels the original red giant phase, but at a higher surface temperature. \n  Massive stars  \n Main article:  Red supergiant  \n \n    \n \n     \n Betelgeuse  is a red supergiant star approaching the end of its life cycle. \n \n \n During their helium-burning phase, very high mass stars with more than nine solar masses expand to form  red supergiants . Once this fuel is exhausted at the core, they continue to fuse elements heavier than helium. \n The core contracts until the temperature and pressure are sufficient to fuse  carbon  (see  carbon burning process ). This process continues, with the successive stages being fueled by  neon  (see  neon burning process ),  oxygen  (see  oxygen burning process ), and  silicon  (see  silicon burning process ). Near the end of the star's life, fusion continues along a series of onion-layer shells within the star. Each shell fuses a different element, with the outermost shell fusing hydrogen; the next shell fusing helium, and so forth.   [ 73 ]    \n The final stage is reached when a massive star begins producing  iron . Since iron nuclei are more  tightly bound  than any heavier nuclei, any fusion beyond iron does not produce a net release of energy\u2014the process would, on the contrary, consume energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, energy cannot be released by  fission .   [ 72 ]    In relatively old, very massive stars, a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star. The heavier elements in these stars can work their way to the surface, forming evolved objects known as  Wolf-Rayet stars  that have a dense stellar wind which sheds the outer atmosphere. \n  Collapse  \n As a star's core shrinks, the intensity of radiation from that surface increases, creating such  radiation pressure  on the outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a  planetary nebula . If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 solar masses, it shrinks to a relatively tiny object about the size of Earth, known as a  white dwarf . It is not massive enough for further gravitational compression to take place.   [ 74 ]    The  electron-degenerate matter  inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs will fade into  black dwarfs  over a very long period of time. \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  Crab Nebula , remnants of a supernova that was first observed around 1050 AD \n \n \n In larger stars, fusion continues until the iron core has grown so large (more than 1.4 solar masses) that it can no longer support its own mass. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons, neutrinos and gamma rays in a burst of  electron capture  and  inverse beta decay . The  shockwave  formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a  supernova . Supernovae are so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as \"new stars\" where none seemingly existed before.   [ 75 ]    \n Most of the star's matter is blown away by the supernova explosion (forming nebulae such as the Crab Nebula).   [ 75 ]    What remains will be a  neutron star  (which sometimes manifests itself as a  pulsar  or  X-ray burster ) or, in the case of the largest stars (large enough to leave a remnant greater than roughly 4 solar masses), a  black hole .   [ 76 ]    In a neutron star the matter is in a state known as  neutron-degenerate matter , with a more exotic form of degenerate matter,  QCD matter , possibly present in the core. Within a black hole the matter is in a state that is not currently understood. \n The blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements, which may be recycled during new star formation. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.   [ 75 ]    \n  Distribution  \n \n    \n \n     \nA  white dwarf  star in orbit around  Sirius  (artist's impression).  NASA image  \n \n \n In addition to isolated stars, a  multi-star system  can consist of two or more gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a  binary star , but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars.   [ 77 ]    Larger groups called  star clusters  also exist. These range from loose  stellar associations  with only a few stars, up to enormous  globular clusters  with hundreds of thousands of stars. \n It has been a long-held assumption that the majority of stars occur in gravitationally bound, multiple-star systems. This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80% of the stars are believed to be part of multiple-star systems. However the proportion of single star systems increases for smaller stars, so that only 25% of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions. As 85% of all stars are red dwarfs, most stars in the Milky Way are likely single from birth.   [ 78 ]    \n Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe, but are normally grouped into galaxies along with interstellar gas and dust. A typical galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are more than 100 billion (10 11 ) galaxies in the  observable universe .   [ 79 ]    A 2010 star count estimate was 300  sextillion  ( 3 \u00d7 10 23  ) in the observable universe.   [ 80 ]    While it is often believed that stars only exist within galaxies, intergalactic stars have been discovered.   [ 81 ]    \n The nearest star to the Earth, apart from the Sun, is  Proxima Centauri , which is 39.9 trillion kilometres, or 4.2 light-years away. Travelling at the orbital speed of the  Space Shuttle  (8 kilometres per second\u2014almost 30,000 kilometres per hour), it would take about 150,000 years to get there.   [ 82 ]    Distances like this are typical inside  galactic discs , including in the vicinity of the solar system.   [ 83 ]    Stars can be much closer to each other in the centres of galaxies and in  globular clusters , or much farther apart in  galactic halos . \n Due to the relatively vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars are thought to be rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common.   [ 84 ]    Such collisions can produce what are known as  blue stragglers . These abnormal stars have a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity in the cluster.   [ 85 ]    \n  Characteristics  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  Sun  is the nearest star to  Earth . \n \n \n Almost everything about a star is determined by its initial mass, including essential characteristics such as luminosity and size, as well as its evolution, lifespan, and eventual fate. \n  Age  \n Most stars are between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may even be close to 13.8 billion years old\u2014the observed  age of the universe . The oldest star yet discovered,  HE\u00a01523-0901 , is an estimated 13.2 billion years old.   [ 86 ]      [ 87 ]    \n The more massive the star, the shorter its lifespan, primarily because massive stars have greater pressure on their cores, causing them to burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and last tens to hundreds of billions of years.   [ 88 ]      [ 89 ]    \n  Chemical composition  \n See also:  Metallicity \u00a0and  Molecules in stars  \n \n \u201cFrom a chemist\u2019s point of view, the surface or interior of a star\u2026is boring\u2014there are no molecules there.\u201d-- Roald Hoffmann    [ 90 ]    \n \n When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71% hydrogen and 27% helium,   [ 91 ]    as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements. Typically the portion of heavy elements is measured in terms of the iron content of the stellar atmosphere, as iron is a common element and its absorption lines are relatively easy to measure. Because the molecular clouds where stars form are steadily enriched by heavier elements, a measurement of the chemical composition of a star can be used to infer its age.   [ 92 ]    The portion of heavier elements may also be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.   [ 93 ]    \n The star with the lowest iron content ever measured is the dwarf HE1327-2326, with only 1/200,000th the iron content of the Sun.   [ 94 ]    By contrast, the super-metal-rich star  \u03bc Leonis  has nearly double the abundance of iron as the Sun, while the planet-bearing star  14 Herculis  has nearly triple the iron.   [ 95 ]    There also exist chemically  peculiar stars  that show unusual abundances of certain elements in their spectrum; especially  chromium  and  rare earth elements .   [ 96 ]    \n  Diameter  \n \n    \n \n     \nStars vary widely in size. In each image in the sequence, the right-most object appears as the left-most object in the next panel. The Earth appears at right in panel 1 and the Sun is second from the right in panel 3. \n \n \n Due to their great distance from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the unaided eye as shining points in the night sky that  twinkle  because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is  R Doradus , with an  angular diameter  of only 0.057  arcseconds .   [ 97 ]    \n The disks of most stars are much too small in  angular size  to be observed with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so  interferometer  telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through  occultation . By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the  Moon  (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.   [ 98 ]    \n Stars range in size from  neutron stars , which vary anywhere from 20 to 40\u00a0km (25\u00a0mi) in diameter, to  supergiants  like  Betelgeuse  in the  Orion constellation , which has a diameter approximately 650 times that of the Sun\u2014about 900,000,000\u00a0km (559,234,073\u00a0mi). Betelgeuse, however, has a much lower  density  than the Sun.   [ 99 ]    \n  Kinematics  \n Main article:  Stellar kinematics  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  Pleiades , an  open cluster  of stars in the  constellation  of  Taurus . These stars share a common motion through space.   [ 100 ]      NASA  photo  \n \n \n The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the  radial velocity  toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its  proper motion . \n Radial velocity is measured by the  doppler shift  of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of  km / s . The proper motion of a star is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli- arc seconds  (mas) per year. By determining the parallax of a star, the proper motion can then be converted into units of velocity. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.   [ 101 ]    \n Once both rates of movement are known, the  space velocity  of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, it has been found that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy.   [ 102 ]    A comparison of the kinematics of nearby stars has also led to the identification of  stellar associations . These are most likely groups of stars that share a common point of origin in giant molecular clouds.   [ 103 ]    \n  Magnetic field  \n Main article:  Stellar magnetic field  \n \n    \n \n     \nSurface magnetic field of  SU\u00a0Aur  (a young star of  T Tauri type ), reconstructed by means of  Zeeman-Doppler imaging  \n \n \n The  magnetic field  of a star is generated within regions of the interior where  convective  circulation occurs. This movement of conductive plasma functions like a  dynamo , generating magnetic fields that extend throughout the star. The strength of the magnetic field varies with the mass and composition of the star, and the amount of magnetic surface activity depends upon the star's rate of rotation. This surface activity produces  starspots , which are regions of strong magnetic fields and lower than normal surface temperatures.  Coronal loops  are arching magnetic fields that reach out into the corona from active regions.  Stellar flares  are bursts of high-energy particles that are emitted due to the same magnetic activity.   [ 104 ]    \n Young, rapidly rotating stars tend to have high levels of surface activity because of their magnetic field. The magnetic field can act upon a star's stellar wind, functioning as a brake to gradually slow the rate of rotation with time. Thus, older stars such as the Sun have a much slower rate of rotation and a lower level of surface activity. The activity levels of slowly rotating stars tend to vary in a cyclical manner and can shut down altogether for periods of time.   [ 105 ]    During the  Maunder minimum , for example, the Sun underwent a 70-year period with almost no sunspot activity. \n  Mass  \n Main article:  Stellar mass  \n One of the most massive stars known is  Eta Carinae ,   [ 106 ]    which, with 100\u2013150\u00a0times as much mass as the Sun, will have a lifespan of only several million years. A study of the  Arches cluster  suggests that 150\u00a0solar masses is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.   [ 107 ]    The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the  Eddington luminosity  which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space. However, a star named  R136a1  in the Large Magellanic Cloud, RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 solar masses, which puts this limit into question.   [ 108 ]    A study determined that stars larger than 150 solar masses in  R136  were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close  binary systems , providing a way to sidestep the 150 solar mass limit.   [ 109 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  reflection nebula   NGC 1999  is brilliantly illuminated by V380 Orionis (center), a variable star with about 3.5\u00a0times the mass of the Sun. The black patch of sky is a vast hole of empty space and not a  dark nebula  as previously thought.  NASA image  \n \n \n The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 solar masses or more,   [ 110 ]    due to the complete absence of elements heavier than  lithium  in their composition. This generation of supermassive,  population III stars  is long extinct, however, and currently only theoretical. \n With a mass only 93\u00a0times that of  Jupiter ,  AB Doradus C , a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.   [ 111 ]    For stars with similar metallicity to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have, and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 times the mass of Jupiter.   [ 112 ]      [ 113 ]    When the metallicity is very low, however, a recent study of the faintest stars found that the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 times the mass of Jupiter.   [ 113 ]      [ 114 ]    Smaller bodies are called  brown dwarfs , which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and  gas giants . \n The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the  absorption lines .   [ 33 ]    \n  Rotation  \n Main article:  Stellar rotation  \n The rotation rate of stars can be determined through  spectroscopic measurement , or more exactly determined by tracking the rotation rate of  starspots . Young stars can have a rapid rate of rotation greater than 100\u00a0km/s at the equator. The B-class star  Achernar , for example, has an equatorial rotation velocity of about 225\u00a0km/s or greater, causing its equator to be slung outward and giving it an equatorial diameter that is more than 50% larger than the distance between the poles. This rate of rotation is just below the critical velocity of 300\u00a0km/s where the star would break apart.   [ 115 ]    By contrast, the Sun only rotates once every 25 \u2013 35 days, with an equatorial velocity of 1.994\u00a0km/s. The star's magnetic field and the stellar wind serve to slow a  main sequence star's  rate of rotation by a significant amount as it evolves on the main sequence.   [ 116 ]    \n  Degenerate stars  have contracted into a compact mass, resulting in a rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of  angular momentum \u2014the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A large portion of the star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind.   [ 117 ]    In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar at the heart of the  Crab nebula , for example, rotates 30 times per second.   [ 118 ]    The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation. \n  Temperature  \n The surface temperature of a main sequence star is determined by the rate of energy production at the core and by its radius, and is often estimated from the star's  color index .   [ 119 ]    The temperature is normally given as the  effective temperature , which is the temperature of an idealized  black body  that radiates its energy at the same luminosity per surface area as the star. Note that the effective temperature is only a representative value, as the temperature increases toward the core.   [ 120 ]    The temperature in the core region of a star is several million\u00a0 kelvins .   [ 121 ]    \n The stellar temperature will determine the rate of ionization of various elements, resulting in characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum. The surface temperature of a star, along with its visual  absolute magnitude  and absorption features, is used to classify a star (see classification below).   [ 33 ]    \n Massive main sequence stars can have surface temperatures of 50,000\u00a0 K . Smaller stars such as the Sun have surface temperatures of a few thousand  K . Red giants have relatively low surface temperatures of about 3,600\u00a0K; but they also have a high luminosity due to their large exterior surface area.   [ 122 ]    \n  Radiation  \n The energy produced by stars, as a product of nuclear fusion, radiates into space as both  electromagnetic radiation  and  particle radiation . The particle radiation emitted by a star is manifested as the stellar wind,   [ 123 ]    which streams from the outer layers as free  protons , and electrically charged  alpha , and  beta particles . Although almost massless there also exists a steady stream of  neutrinos  emanating from the star's core. \n The production of energy at the core is the reason stars shine so brightly: every time two or more atomic nuclei fuse together to form a single  atomic nucleus  of a new heavier element,  gamma ray   photons  are released from the nuclear fusion product. This energy is converted to other forms of  electromagnetic energy  of lower frequency, such as visible light, by the time it reaches the star's outer layers. \n The  color  of a star, as determined by the most intense  frequency  of the visible light, depends on the temperature of the star's outer layers, including its  photosphere .   [ 124 ]    Besides visible light, stars also emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the  human eye . In fact, stellar electromagnetic radiation spans the entire  electromagnetic spectrum , from the longest  wavelengths  of  radio waves  through  infrared , visible light,  ultraviolet , to the shortest of  X-rays , and  gamma rays . From the standpoint of total energy emitted by a star, not all components of stellar electromagnetic radiation are significant, but all frequencies provide insight into the star's physics. \n Using the  stellar spectrum , astronomers can also determine the surface temperature,  surface gravity , metallicity and  rotational  velocity of a star. If the distance of the star is known, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star can be derived. The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in  binary systems  by measuring their orbital velocities and distances.  Gravitational microlensing  has been used to measure the mass of a single star.   [ 125 ]   ) With these parameters, astronomers can also estimate the age of the star.   [ 126 ]    \n  Luminosity  \n The luminosity of a star is the amount of  light  and other forms of  radiant energy  it radiates per unit of time. It has units of  power . The luminosity of a star is determined by the radius and the surface temperature. However, many stars do not radiate a uniform  flux  (the amount of energy radiated per unit area) across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star  Vega , for example, has a higher energy flux at its poles than along its equator.   [ 127 ]    \n Surface patches with a lower temperature and luminosity than average are known as  starspots . Small,  dwarf  stars such as our Sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots. Larger,  giant  stars have much larger, more obvious starspots,   [ 128 ]    and they also exhibit strong stellar  limb darkening . That is, the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk.   [ 129 ]    Red dwarf  flare stars  such as  UV Ceti  may also possess prominent starspot features.   [ 130 ]    \n  Magnitude  \n Main articles:  Apparent magnitude  and  Absolute magnitude  \n The apparent  brightness  of a star is expressed in terms of its  apparent magnitude , which is the brightness of a star and is a function of the star's luminosity, distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years). \n \n  Number of stars brighter than magnitude  \n \n Apparent \nmagnitude \n Number\u00a0 \nof\u00a0Stars   [ 131 ]    \n \n \n 0 \n 4 \n \n \n 1 \n 15 \n \n \n 2 \n 48 \n \n \n 3 \n 171 \n \n \n 4 \n 513 \n \n \n 5 \n 1,602 \n \n \n 6 \n 4,800 \n \n \n 7 \n 14,000 \n \n \n Both the apparent and absolute magnitude scales are  logarithmic units : one whole number difference in magnitude is equal to a brightness variation of about 2.5 times   [ 132 ]    (the  5th root  of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude (+1.00) star is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and approximately 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude (+6.00) star. The faintest stars visible to the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6. \n On both apparent and absolute magnitude scales, the smaller the magnitude number, the brighter the star; the larger the magnitude number, the fainter. The brightest stars, on either scale, have negative magnitude numbers. The variation in brightness (\u0394 L ) between two stars is calculated by subtracting the magnitude number of the brighter star ( m  b ) from the magnitude number of the fainter star ( m  f ), then using the difference as an exponent for the base number 2.512; that is to say: \n \n   \n   \n \n Relative to both luminosity and distance from Earth, a star's absolute magnitude ( M ) and apparent magnitude ( m ) are not equivalent;   [ 132 ]    for example, the bright star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of \u22121.44, but it has an absolute magnitude of +1.41. \n The Sun has an apparent magnitude of \u221226.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while  Canopus , the second brightest star in the night sky with an absolute magnitude of \u22125.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years. \n As of 2006, the star with the highest known absolute magnitude is  LBV 1806-20 , with a magnitude of \u221214.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun.   [ 133 ]    The least luminous stars that are currently known are located in the  NGC 6397  cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon when viewed from the Earth.

[ 136 ]    It was not known at the time that the major influence on the line strength was temperature; the hydrogen line strength reaches a peak at over 9000\u00a0K, and is weaker at both hotter and cooler temperatures. When the classifications were reordered by temperature, it more closely resembled the modern scheme.   [ 137 ]    \n Stars are given a single-letter classification according to their spectra, ranging from type  O , which are very hot, to  M , which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are:  O, B, A, F, G, K , and  M . A variety of rare spectral types have special classifications. The most common of these are types  L  and  T , which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures: class  O0  and  O1  stars may not exist.   [ 138 ]    \n In addition, stars may be classified by the luminosity effects found in their spectral lines, which correspond to their spatial size and is determined by the surface gravity. These range from  0  ( hypergiants ) through  III  ( giants ) to  V  (main sequence dwarfs); some authors add  VII  (white dwarfs). Most stars belong to the  main sequence , which consists of ordinary  hydrogen-burning  stars. These fall along a narrow, diagonal band when graphed according to their absolute magnitude and spectral type.   [ 138 ]    The Sun is a main sequence  G2V  yellow dwarf of intermediate temperature and ordinary size. \n Additional nomenclature, in the form of lower-case letters, can follow the spectral type to indicate peculiar features of the spectrum. For example, an \" e \" can indicate the presence of emission lines; \" m \" represents unusually strong levels of metals, and \" var \" can mean variations in the spectral type.   [ 138 ]    \n White dwarf stars have their own class that begins with the letter  D . This is further sub-divided into the classes  DA ,  DB ,  DC ,  DO ,  DZ , and  DQ , depending on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This is followed by a numerical value that indicates the temperature index.   [ 139 ]    \n  Variable stars  \n Main article:  Variable star  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe asymmetrical appearance of  Mira , an oscillating variable star.  NASA  HST  image  \n \n \n Variable stars have periodic or random changes in luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically variable stars, the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups. \n During their stellar evolution, some stars pass through phases where they can become pulsating variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, depending on the size of the star. This category includes  Cepheid and cepheid-like stars , and long-period variables such as  Mira .   [ 140 ]    \n Eruptive variables are stars that experience sudden increases in luminosity because of flares or mass ejection events.   [ 140 ]    This group includes protostars, Wolf-Rayet stars, and  Flare stars , as well as giant and supergiant stars. \n Cataclysmic or explosive variable stars are those that undergo a dramatic change in their properties. This group includes  novae  and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova.   [ 4 ]    The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion.   [ 141 ]    Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.   [ 140 ]    \n Stars can also vary in luminosity because of extrinsic factors, such as eclipsing binaries, as well as rotating stars that produce extreme starspots.   [ 140 ]    A notable example of an eclipsing binary is Algol, which regularly varies in magnitude from 2.3 to 3.5 over a period of 2.87 days. \n  Structure  \n Main article:  Stellar structure  \n \n    \n \n     \nInternal structures of  main sequence stars , convection zones with arrowed cycles and radiative zones with red flashes. To the left a  low-mass   red dwarf , in the center a  mid-sized   yellow dwarf  and at the right a  massive   blue-white main sequence star . \n \n \n The interior of a stable star is in a state of  hydrostatic equilibrium : the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. The balanced forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure  gradient  within the star. The  pressure gradient  is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 10 7   K . The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for  nuclear fusion  to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.   [ 142 ]      [ 143 ]    \n As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit energy in the form of  gamma rays . These photons interact with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 solar masses, fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the  degenerate  helium core.   [ 144 ]    \n In addition to hydrostatic equilibrium, the interior of a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of  thermal equilibrium . There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior that results in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior. The outgoing flux of energy leaving any layer within the star will exactly match the incoming flux from below. \n The  radiation zone  is the region within the stellar interior where radiative transfer is sufficiently efficient to maintain the flux of energy. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a  convection zone . This can occur, for example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high  opacity  as in the outer envelope.   [ 143 ]    \n The occurrence of convection in the outer envelope of a main sequence star depends on the mass. Stars with several times the mass of the Sun have a convection zone deep within the interior and a radiative zone in the outer layers. Smaller stars such as the Sun are just the opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers.   [ 145 ]    Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 solar masses are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core.   [ 2 ]    For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.   [ 143 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nThis diagram shows a cross-section of the  Sun .  NASA image  \n \n \n The portion of a star that is visible to an observer is called the  photosphere . This is the layer at which the plasma of the star becomes transparent to photons of light. From here, the energy generated at the core becomes free to propagate out into space. It is within the photosphere that  sun spots , or regions of lower than average temperature, appear. \n Above the level of the photosphere is the  stellar atmosphere . In a main sequence star such as the Sun, the lowest level of the atmosphere is the thin  chromosphere  region, where  spicules  appear and  stellar flares  begin. This is surrounded by a transition region, where the temperature rapidly increases within a distance of only 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi). Beyond this is the  corona , a volume of super-heated plasma that can extend outward to several million kilometres.   [ 146 ]    The existence of a corona appears to be dependent on a convective zone in the outer layers of the star.   [ 145 ]    Despite its high temperature, the corona emits very little light. The corona region of the Sun is normally only visible during a  solar eclipse . \n From the corona, a  stellar wind  of plasma particles expands outward from the star, propagating until it interacts with the  interstellar medium . For the Sun, the influence of its  solar wind  extends throughout the bubble-shaped region of the  heliosphere .   [ 147 ]    \n  Nuclear fusion reaction pathways  \n Main article:  Stellar nucleosynthesis  \n \n \n \n     \n Overview of the proton-proton chain \n \n \n     \n The carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle \n \n \n \n A variety of different nuclear fusion reactions take place inside the cores of stars, depending upon their mass and composition, as part of  stellar nucleosynthesis . The net mass of the fused atomic nuclei is smaller than the sum of the constituents. This lost mass is released as electromagnetic energy, according to the  mass-energy equivalence  relationship  E \u00a0=\u00a0 mc  2 .   [ 1 ]    \n The hydrogen fusion process is temperature-sensitive, so a moderate increase in the core temperature will result in a significant increase in the fusion rate. As a result the core temperature of main sequence stars only varies from 4 million kelvin for a small M-class star to 40 million kelvin for a massive O-class star.   [ 121 ]    \n In the Sun, with a 10-million-kelvin core, hydrogen fuses to form helium in the  proton-proton chain reaction :   [ 148 ]    \n \n 4  1 H  \u2192 2  2 H  + 2 e +   + 2 \u03bd e   (4.0 M eV  + 1.0 MeV) \n 2 1 H + 2 2 H \u2192 2  3 He  + 2 \u03b3  (5.5 MeV) \n 2 3 He \u2192   4 He  + 2 1 H (12.9 MeV) \n \n These reactions result in the overall reaction: \n \n 4 1 H \u2192  4 He + 2e +  + 2\u03b3 + 2\u03bd e  (26.7 MeV) \n \n where e +  is a  positron , \u03b3 is a gamma ray photon, \u03bd e  is a  neutrino , and H and He are isotopes of hydrogen and helium, respectively. The energy released by this reaction is in millions of electron volts, which is actually only a tiny amount of energy. However enormous numbers of these reactions occur constantly, producing all the energy necessary to sustain the star's radiation output. \n \n Minimum stellar mass required for fusion \n \n Element \n  Solar \nmasses  \n \n \n Hydrogen \n 0.01 \n \n \n Helium \n 0.4 \n \n \n Carbon \n 5   [ 149 ]    \n \n \n Neon \n 8 \n \n \n In more massive stars, helium is produced in a cycle of reactions  catalyzed  by carbon\u2014the  carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle .   [ 148 ]    \n In evolved stars with cores at 100 million kelvin and masses between 0.5 and 10 solar masses, helium can be transformed into carbon in the  triple-alpha process  that uses the intermediate element  beryllium :   [ 148 ]    \n \n  4 He +  4 He + 92 keV \u2192   8* Be  \n  4 He +  8* Be + 67 keV \u2192  12* C \n  12* C \u2192   12 C  + \u03b3 + 7.4 MeV \n \n For an overall reaction of: \n \n 3 4 He \u2192  12 C + \u03b3 + 7.2 MeV \n \n In massive stars, heavier elements can also be burned in a contracting core through the  neon burning process  and  oxygen burning process . The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the  silicon burning process  that results in the production of the stable isotope iron-56. Fusion can not proceed any further except through an  endothermic  process, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.   [ 148 ]    \n The example below shows the amount of time required for a star of 20 solar masses to consume all of its nuclear fuel. As an O-class main sequence star, it would be 8 times the solar radius and 62,000 times the Sun's luminosity.

As a branch of  astronomy , star formation includes the study of the  interstellar medium  and  giant molecular clouds  (GMC) as precursors to the star formation process, and the study of  protostars  and  young stellar objects  as its immediate products. It is closely related to  planet formation , another branch of  astronomy . Star formation theory, as well as accounting for the formation of a single star, must also account for the statistics of  binary stars  and the  initial mass function . \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Stellar nurseries  \n \n   1.1   Interstellar clouds   \n   1.2   Empty space   \n   1.3   Cloud collapse   \n \n \n   2   Protostar   \n   3   Observations  \n \n   3.1   Notable pathfinder objects   \n \n \n   4   Low mass and high mass star formation   \n   5   See also   \n   6   References   \n \n \n  \n  Stellar nurseries   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Hubble telescope  image known as   Pillars of Creation ,  where stars are forming in the  Eagle Nebula . \n \n \n  Interstellar clouds   [  edit  ]   \n A  spiral galaxy  like the  Milky Way  contains  stars ,  stellar remnants , and a diffuse  interstellar medium  (ISM) of gas and dust. The interstellar medium consists of 10 \u22124  to 10 6  particles per cm 3  and is typically composed of roughly 70%  hydrogen  by mass, with most of the remaining gas consisting of  helium . This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of  heavier elements  that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their  main sequence  lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or   diffuse nebulae  ,   [ 1 ]    where star formation takes place.   [ 2 ]    In contrast to spirals, an  elliptical galaxy  loses the cold component of its interstellar medium within roughly a billion years, which hinders the galaxy from forming diffuse nebulae except through mergers with other galaxies.   [ 3 ]    \n In the dense nebulae where stars are produced, much of the hydrogen is in the molecular (H 2 ) form, so these nebulae are called  molecular clouds .   [ 2 ]    Observations indicate that the coldest clouds tend to form low-mass stars, observed first in the infrared inside the clouds, then in visible light at their surface when the clouds dissipate, while giant molecular clouds, which are generally warmer, produce stars of all masses.   [ 4 ]    These giant molecular clouds have typical densities of 100 particles per cm 3 , diameters of 100  light-years  (9.5 \u00d7 10 14 \u00a0 km ), masses of up to 6\u00a0million  solar masses ,   [ 5 ]    and an average interior temperature of 10\u00a0K. About half the total mass of the galactic ISM is found in molecular clouds   [ 6 ]    and in the  Milky Way  there are an estimated 6,000 molecular clouds, each with more than 100,000 solar masses.   [ 7 ]    The nearest nebula to the  Sun  where massive stars are being formed is the  Orion nebula , 1,300\u00a0ly (1.2 \u00d7 10 16 \u00a0km) away.   [ 8 ]    However, lower mass star formation is occurring about 400\u2013450 light years distant in the  \u03c1 Ophiuchi cloud complex .   [ 9 ]    \n A more compact site of star formation is the opaque clouds of dense gas and dust known as  Bok globules ; so named after the astronomer  Bart Bok . These can form in association with collapsing molecular clouds or possibly independently.   [ 10 ]    The Bok globules are typically up to a light year across and contain a few  solar masses .   [ 11 ]    They can be observed as dark clouds silhouetted against bright  emission nebulae  or background stars. Over half the known Bok globules have been found to contain newly forming stars.   [ 12 ]    \n  Empty space   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n2MASX J09442693+0429569 marks a transitional phase in this process as young, star-forming galaxies settle to become massive, red and dead galaxies.   [ 13 ]    \n \n \n A discovery by the infrared telescope  Herschel  in conjunction with other ground based telescopes, determined that black patches of space in certain areas encompassing a star formation were not  dark nebulae  but actually vast holes of empty space. Such is the case of the area  NGC 1999  and its star  V380 Orionis . The exact cause of this phenomenon is still being investigated, although it has been hypothesized that narrow jets of gas from some of the young stars in the region punctured the sheet of dust and gas, as well as powerful radiation from a nearby mature star may have helped to create the hole. This was a previously unknown and unexpected step in the star-forming process.   [ 14 ]    \n  Cloud collapse   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nStellar cluster and  star-forming region   M 17 . \n \n \n An interstellar cloud of gas will remain in  hydrostatic equilibrium  as long as the  kinetic energy  of the gas  pressure  is in balance with the  potential energy  of the internal  gravitational force . Mathematically this is expressed using the  virial theorem , which states that, to maintain equilibrium, the gravitational potential energy must equal twice the internal thermal energy.   [ 15 ]    If a cloud is massive enough that the gas pressure is insufficient to support it, the cloud will undergo  gravitational collapse . The mass above which a cloud will undergo such collapse is called the  Jeans mass . The Jeans mass depends on the temperature and density of the cloud, but is typically thousands to tens of thousands of solar masses.   [ 2 ]    This coincides with the typical mass of an  open cluster  of stars, which is the end product of a collapsing cloud.   [ 16 ]    \n In  triggered star formation , one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its  gravitational collapse . Molecular clouds may collide with each other, or a nearby  supernova  explosion can be a trigger, sending  shocked  matter into the cloud at very high speeds.   [ 2 ]    Alternatively,  galactic collisions  can trigger massive  starbursts  of star formation as the gas clouds in each galaxy are compressed and agitated by  tidal forces .   [ 17 ]    The latter mechanism may be responsible for the formation of  globular clusters .   [ 18 ]    \n A  supermassive black hole  at the core of a galaxy may serve to regulate the rate of star formation in a galactic nucleus. A black hole that is accreting infalling matter can become  active , emitting a strong wind through a collimated  relativistic jet . This can limit further star formation. However, the radio emissions around the jets may also trigger star formation. Likewise, a weaker jet may trigger star formation when it collides with a cloud.   [ 19 ]    \n As it collapses, a molecular cloud breaks into smaller and smaller pieces in a hierarchical manner, until the fragments reach stellar mass. In each of these fragments, the collapsing gas radiates away the energy gained by the release of  gravitational   potential energy . As the density increases, the fragments become opaque and are thus less efficient at radiating away their energy. This raises the temperature of the cloud and inhibits further fragmentation. The fragments now condense into rotating spheres of gas that serve as stellar embryos.   [ 20 ]    \n Complicating this picture of a collapsing cloud are the effects of  turbulence , macroscopic flows,  rotation ,  magnetic fields  and the cloud geometry. Both rotation and magnetic fields can hinder the collapse of a cloud.   [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]    Turbulence is instrumental in causing fragmentation of the cloud, and on the smallest scales it promotes collapse.   [ 23 ]    \n  Protostar   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Protostar  \n \n    \n \n     \n LH 95  stellar nursery in Large Magellanic Cloud. \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \n Composite image  showing young stars in and around molecular cloud  Cepheus  B. \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nN11, part of a complex network of gas clouds and star clusters within our neighbouring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. \n \n \n A protostellar cloud will continue to collapse as long as the gravitational binding energy can be eliminated. This excess energy is primarily lost through radiation. However, the collapsing cloud will eventually become opaque to its own radiation, and the energy must be removed through some other means. The dust within the cloud becomes heated to temperatures of  60\u2013100 K , and these particles radiate at wavelengths in the far infrared where the cloud is transparent. Thus the dust mediates the further collapse of the cloud.   [ 24 ]    \n During the collapse, the density of the cloud increases toward the center and thus the middle region becomes optically opaque first. This occurs when the density is about  10 \u221213  g cm \u22123  . A core region, called the First Hydrostatic Core, forms where the collapse is essentially halted. It continues to increase in temperature as determined by the virial theorem. The gas falling toward this opaque region collides with it and creates shock waves that further heat the core.   [ 25 ]    \n When the core temperature reaches about  2000 K , the thermal energy dissociates the H 2  molecules.   [ 25 ]    This is followed by the ionization of the hydrogen and helium atoms. These processes absorb the energy of the contraction, allowing it to continue on timescales comparable to the period of collapse at free fall velocities.   [ 26 ]    After the density of infalling material has dropped below about 10 \u22128  g cm \u22123 , that material is sufficiently transparent to allow energy radiated by the protostar to escape. The combination of convection within the protostar and radiation from its exterior allow the star to contract further.   [ 25 ]    This continues until the gas is hot enough for the internal  pressure  to support the protostar against further gravitational collapse\u2014a state called  hydrostatic equilibrium . When this accretion phase is nearly complete, the resulting object is known as a  protostar .   [ 2 ]    \n Accretion of material onto the protostar continues partially from the newly formed  circumstellar disc . When the density and temperature are high enough,  deuterium fusion  begins, and the outward  pressure  of the resultant radiation slows (but does not stop) the collapse. Material comprising the cloud continues to \"rain\" onto the  protostar . In this stage bipolar jets are produced called  Herbig-Haro objects . This is probably the means by which excess  angular momentum  of the infalling material is expelled, allowing the star to continue to form. \n When the surrounding gas and dust envelope disperses and accretion process stops, the star is considered a  pre\u2013main sequence star  (PMS star). The energy source of these objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main sequence stars. The PMS star follows a  Hayashi track  on the  Hertzsprung\u2013Russell (H\u2013R) diagram .   [ 27 ]    The contraction will proceed until the  Hayashi limit  is reached, and thereafter contraction will continue on a  Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz timescale  with the temperature remaining stable. Stars with less than 0.5  solar masses  thereafter join the main sequence. For more massive PMS stars, at the end of the Hayashi track they will slowly collapse in near hydrostatic equilibrium, following the  Henyey track .   [ 28 ]    \n Finally,  hydrogen  begins to fuse in the core of the star, and the rest of the enveloping material is cleared away. This ends the protostellar phase and begins the star's  main sequence  phase on the H\u2013R diagram. \n The stages of the process are well defined in stars with masses around one  solar mass  or less. In high mass stars, the length of the star formation process is comparable to the other timescales of their evolution, much shorter, and the process is not so well defined. The later evolution of stars are studied in  stellar evolution . \n  Observations   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  Orion Nebula  is an archetypical example of star formation, from the massive, young stars that are shaping the nebula to the pillars of dense gas that may be the homes of budding stars. \n \n \n Key elements of star formation are only available by observing in  wavelengths  other than the  optical . The protostellar stage of stellar existence is almost invariably hidden away deep inside dense clouds of gas and dust left over from the  GMC . Often, these star-forming cocoons known as  Bok globules , can be seen in  silhouette  against bright emission from surrounding gas.   [ 29 ]    Early stages of a star's life can be seen in  infrared  light, which penetrates the dust more easily than  visible  light.   [ 30 ]    \n The structure of the molecular cloud and the effects of the protostar can be observed in near-IR  extinction  maps (where the number of stars are counted per unit area and compared to a nearby zero extinction area of sky), continuum dust emission and  rotational transitions  of  CO  and other molecules; these last two are observed in the millimeter and  submillimeter  range. The radiation from the protostar and early star has to be observed in  infrared astronomy  wavelengths, as the  extinction  caused by the rest of the cloud in which the star is forming is usually too big to allow us to observe it in the visual part of the spectrum. This presents considerable difficulties as the Earth's atmosphere is almost entirely opaque from 20\u03bcm to 850\u03bcm, with narrow windows at 200\u03bcm and 450\u03bcm. Even outside this range, atmospheric subtraction techniques must be used. \n The formation of individual stars can only be directly observed in  our Galaxy , but in distant galaxies star formation has been detected through its unique  spectral signature . \n  Notable pathfinder objects   [  edit  ]   \n \n  MWC 349  was first discovered in 1978, and is estimated to be only 1,000 years old. \n VLA 1623 \u2013 The first exemplar Class 0 protostar, a type of embedded protostar that has yet to accrete the majority of its mass. Found in 1993, is possibly younger than 10,000 years  [1] . \n  L1014  \u2013 An incredibly faint embedded object representative of a new class of sources that are only now being detected with the newest telescopes. Their status is still undetermined, they could be the youngest low-mass Class 0 protostars yet seen or even very low-mass evolved objects (like a  brown dwarf  or even an  interstellar planet ).  [2] . \n  IRS 8*  \u2013 The youngest known  main sequence  star in the  Galactic Center  region, discovered in August 2006. It is estimated to be 3.5 million years old  [3] . \n \n  Low mass and high mass star formation   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nStar-forming region S106. \n \n \n Stars of different masses are thought to form by slightly different mechanisms. The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well-supported by a plethora of observations, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds. As described above, the collapse of a rotating cloud of gas and dust leads to the formation of an accretion disk through which matter is channeled onto a central protostar. For stars with masses higher than about 8 solar masses, however, the mechanism of star formation is not well understood. \n Massive stars emit copious quantities of radiation which pushes against infalling material. In the past, it was thought that this  radiation pressure  might be substantial enough to halt accretion onto the massive protostar and prevent the formation of stars with masses more than a few tens of solar masses.   [ 31 ]    Recent theoretical work has shown that the production of a jet and outflow clears a cavity through which much of the radiation from a massive protostar can escape without hindering accretion through the disk and onto the protostar.   [ 32 ]      [ 33 ]    Present thinking is that massive stars may therefore be able to form by a mechanism similar to that by which low mass stars form. \n There is mounting evidence that at least some massive protostars are indeed surrounded by accretion disks. Several other theories of massive star formation remain to be tested observationally. Of these, perhaps the most prominent is the theory of competitive accretion, which suggests that massive protostars are \"seeded\" by low-mass protostars which compete with other protostars to draw in matter from the entire parent molecular cloud, instead of simply from a small local region.   [ 34 ]      [ 35 ]    \n Another theory of massive star formation suggests that massive stars may form by the coalescence of two or more stars of lower mass.

Milky Way .   [ 7 ]    At a distance of slightly less than 50  kiloparsecs  (\u2248163,000  light-years ),   [ 2 ]      [ 3 ]      [ 4 ]      [ 5 ]    the LMC is the third closest galaxy to the Milky Way, with the  Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal  (~ 16 kiloparsecs) and the putative  Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy  (~ 12.9 kiloparsecs, though its status as a galaxy is under  dispute ) lying closer to the center of the Milky Way. It has a mass equivalent to approximately 10 billion times the mass of the Sun (10 10   solar masses ), making it roughly 1/100 as massive as the Milky Way, and a diameter of about 14,000 light-years (~ 4.3  kpc ).   [ 8 ]    The LMC is the fourth largest galaxy in the  Local Group , after the  Andromeda Galaxy  (M31), the Milky Way, and the  Triangulum Galaxy  (M33). \n While the LMC is often considered an irregular type galaxy (the  NASA Extragalactic Database  lists the  Hubble sequence  type as Irr/SB(s)m), the LMC contains a very prominent bar in its center, suggesting that it may have previously been a barred spiral galaxy. The LMC's irregular appearance is possibly the result of tidal interactions with both the Milky Way and the  Small Magellanic Cloud  (SMC). \n It is visible as a faint \"cloud\" in the night sky of the  southern hemisphere  straddling the border between the  constellations  of  Dorado  and  Mensa , and it appears from  Earth  more than 20 times the width of the  full moon .

[ 10 ]      [ 11 ]    \n The next recorded observation was in 1503\u20134 by  Amerigo Vespucci  in a letter about his third voyage. In this letter he mentions \"three Canopes, two bright and one obscure\"; \"bright\" refers to the two  Magellanic Clouds , and \"obscure\" refers to the  Coalsack .   [ 12 ]    \n  Ferdinand Magellan  sighted the LMC on his voyage in 1519, and his writings brought the LMC into common  Western  knowledge. The galaxy now bears his name.   [ 11 ]    \n Announced in 2006, measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds may be moving too fast to be orbiting the  Milky Way .   [ 13 ]    \n  Geometry   [  edit  ]   \n The Large Magellanic Cloud is usually considered an  irregular galaxy . However, it shows signs of a bar structure, and is often reclassified as a  Magellanic-type   dwarf spiral galaxy ). \n The Large Magellanic Cloud has a prominent central bar and a  spiral arm .   [ 14 ]    The central bar seems to be warped so that the east and west ends are nearer the Milky Way than the middle.   [ 15 ]    \n The LMC was long considered to be a planar galaxy that could be assumed to lie at a single distance from us. However, in 1986, Caldwell and Coulson   [ 16 ]    found that field  Cepheid  variables in the northeast portion of the LMC lie closer to the Milky Way than Cepheids in the southwest portion. More recently, this inclined geometry for field stars in the LMC has been confirmed via observations of Cepheids,   [ 17 ]    core helium-burning red clump stars   [ 18 ]    and the tip of the red giant branch.   [ 19 ]    All three of these papers find an inclination of ~35\u00b0, where a face-on galaxy has an inclination of 0\u00b0. Further work on the structure of the LMC using the kinematics of carbon stars showed that the LMC's disk is both thick   [ 19 ]    and flared.   [ 20 ]    Regarding the distribution of  star clusters  in the LMC,  Schommer   et al.    [ 21 ]    measured velocities for ~80 clusters and found that the LMC's cluster system has kinematics consistent with the clusters moving in a disk-like distribution. These results were confirmed by Grocholski  et al. ,   [ 22 ]    who calculated distances to a number of clusters and showed that the LMC's cluster system is in fact distributed in the same plane as the field stars. \n  Distance   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nLocation of the  Large Magellanic Cloud  with respect to the  Milky Way  and other satellite galaxies \n \n \n Determining a precise distance to the LMC, as with any other galaxy, was challenging due to the use of  standard candles  for calculating distances, with the primary problem being that many of the standard candles are not as 'standard' as one would like; in many cases, the age and/or  metallicity  of the standard candle plays a role in determining the intrinsic luminosity of the object. The distance to the LMC has been calculated using a variety of standard candles, with  Cepheid  variables being one of the most popular. Cepheids have been shown to have a relationship between their absolute luminosity and the period over which their brightness varies. However, Cepheids appear to suffer from a metallicity effect, where Cepheids of different metallicities have different period\u2013luminosity relations. Unfortunately, the Cepheids in the Milky Way typically used to calibrate the period\u2013luminosity relation are more metal rich than those found in the LMC.   [ 23 ]    \n In the era of 8-meter-class telescopes,  eclipsing binaries  have been found throughout the  Local Group . Parameters of these systems can be measured without mass or compositional assumptions. The  light echoes  of  supernova 1987A  are also geometric measurements, without any stellar models or assumptions. \n Recently, the Cepheid absolute luminosity has been re-calibrated using Cepheid variables in the galaxy NGC 4258 that cover a range of metallicities.   [ 2 ]    Using this improved calibration, they find an absolute distance modulus of  18.41, or 48 kpc (~157,000 light years). This distance, which is slightly shorter than the typically assumed distance of 50 kpc, has been confirmed by other authors.   [ 3 ]      [ 4 ]    \n By cross-correlating different measurement methods, one can bound the distance; the residual errors are now less than the estimated size parameters of the LMC. Further work involves measuring the position of a target star or star system within the galaxy (i.e. toward or away from the observer). \n The results of a study using late-type eclipsing binaries to determine the distance more accurately was published in  Nature  in March 2013. A distance of 49.97 kpc (162,983 light-years) with an accuracy of 2.2% was obtained.   [ 5 ]    \n  Features   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nTwo very different glowing gas clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud   [ 24 ]    \n \n \n Like many  irregular galaxies , the LMC is rich in gas and dust, and it is currently undergoing vigorous  star formation  activity.   [ 25 ]    It is home to the  Tarantula Nebula , the most active star-forming region in the Local Group. \n The LMC is full of a wide range of galactic objects and phenomena that make it aptly known as an \"astronomical treasure-house, a great celestial laboratory for the study of the growth and evolution of the stars,\" as described by  Robert Burnham, Jr.    [ 26 ]    Surveys of the galaxy have found roughly 60  globular clusters , 400  planetary nebulae , and 700  open clusters , along with hundreds of thousands of  giant  and  supergiant  stars.   [ 27 ]     Supernova 1987a \u2014the nearest  supernova  in recent years\u2014was also located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The  Lionel-Murphy SNR  is  nitrogen -abundant  supernova remnant  (SNR) N86 in the Large Magellanic Cloud named by  astronomers  at the  Australian National University 's  Mount Stromlo Observatory  in acknowledgement of  Australian High Court  Justice  Lionel Murphy 's interest in science and because of SNR N86's perceived resemblance to his large nose.   [ 28 ]    \n There is a  bridge of gas  connecting the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with the LMC, which is evidence of tidal interaction between the galaxies.   [ 29 ]    The Magellanic Clouds have a common envelope of neutral hydrogen indicating they have been gravitationally bound for a long time. This bridge of gas is a star-forming site.   [ 30 ]    \n  X-ray sources   [  edit  ]   \n No X-rays above background were observed from the Magellanic Clouds during the September 20, 1966,  Nike-Tomahawk  flight.   [ 31 ]    A second Nike-Tomahawk rocket was launched from  Johnston Atoll  on September 22, 1966, at 17:13 UTC and reached an apogee of 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi), with spin-stabilization at 5.6 rps.   [ 32 ]    The LMC was not detected in the X-ray range 8-80 keV.   [ 32 ]    \n Another Nike-Tomahawk was launched from Johnston Atoll at 11:32 UTC on October 29, 1968, to scan the LMC for X-rays.   [ 33 ]    The first discrete X-ray source in  Dorado  was at  RA  05 h \u00a020 m   Dec  \u221269\u00b0,   [ 33 ]      [ 34 ]    and it was the Large Magellanic Cloud.   [ 35 ]    This X-ray source extended over about 12\u00b0 and is consistent with the Cloud.   [ 33 ]    Its emission rate between 1.5-10.5 keV for a distance of 50 kpc is 4 x 10 38  ergs/s.   [ 33 ]    An  X-ray astronomy  instrument was carried aboard a  Thor missile  launched from  Johnston Atoll  on September 24, 1970, at 12:54 UTC and altitudes above 300\u00a0km (186\u00a0mi), to search for the  Small Magellanic Cloud  and to extend previous observations of the LMC.   [ 36 ]    The source in the LMC appeared extended and contained the star \u03b5 Dor.   [ 36 ]    The X-ray luminosity (L x ) over the range 1.5\u201312 keV was 6 \u00d7 10 31  W (6 \u00d7 10 38  erg/s).   [ 36 ]    \n The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is in the constellations  Mensa  and  Dorado . LMC X-1 (the first X-ray source in the LMC) is at  RA  05 h \u00a040 m \u00a005 s   Dec  \u221269\u00b0\u00a045\u2032\u00a051\u2033, and is a high mass X-ray binary source ( HMXB ).   [ 37 ]    Of the first five luminous LMC X-ray binaries: LMC X-1, X-2, X-3, X-4, and A 0538-66 (detected by  Ariel 5  at A 0538-66);  LMC X-2  is the only one that is a bright low-mass X-ray binary system ( LMXB ) in the LMC.   [ 38 ]    \n DEM L316 in the Large Magellanic Cloud consists of two supernove remnants.   [ 39 ]     Chandra  X-ray spectra show that the hot gas shell on the upper left contains a high abundance of iron.   [ 39 ]    This implies that the upper left  SNR  is the product of a  Type Ia supernova .   [ 39 ]    The much lower iron abundance in the lower SNR indicates a  Type II supernova .   [ 39 ]    \n A 16 ms X-ray pulsar is associated with SNR 0538-69.1.   [ 40 ]    SNR 0540-697 was resolved using  ROSAT .

(August 2012)    \n \n \n From a viewpoint in the LMC, the Milky Way would be a spectacular sight. The galaxy's total  apparent magnitude  would be \u22122.0\u2014over 14 times brighter than the LMC appears to us on Earth\u2014and it would span about 36 \u00b0  across the sky, which is the width of over 70 full moons. Furthermore, because of the LMC's high  galactic latitude , an observer there would get an oblique view of the entire galaxy, free from the interference of  interstellar dust  which makes studying in the Milky Way's plane difficult from Earth.   [ 42 ]    The  Small Magellanic Cloud  would be about magnitude 0.6, substantially brighter than the LMC appears to us. \n  Gallery   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n The star formation region  NGC 2035  imaged by the  ESO   VLT    [ 43 ]    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n LHA 120-N11 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Eisenhower  established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958   [ 5 ]    with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The  National Aeronautics and Space Act  was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  (NACA). The new agency became operational on October 1, 1958.   [ 6 ]      [ 7 ]    \n Since that time, most U.S. space exploration efforts have been led by NASA, including the  Apollo   moon-landing  missions, the  Skylab  space station, and later the  Space Shuttle . Currently, NASA is supporting the  International Space Station  and is overseeing the development of the  Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle , the  Space Launch System  and  Commercial Crew  vehicles. The agency is also responsible for the  Launch Services Program  (LSP) which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for unmanned NASA launches. \n NASA science is focused on better understanding Earth through the  Earth Observing System ,   [ 8 ]    advancing  heliophysics  through the efforts of the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program,   [ 9 ]    exploring bodies throughout the  Solar System  with advanced robotic missions such as   New Horizons  ,   [ 10 ]    and researching  astrophysics  topics, such as the  Big Bang , through the  Great Observatories  and associated programs.

They are discussing the  Mariner program , with a model presented. \n \n \n From 1946, the  National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics  (NACA) had been experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic  Bell X-1 .   [ 12 ]    In the early 1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the  International Geophysical Year  (1957\u201358). An effort for this was the American  Project Vanguard . After the  Soviet  launch of the world's first artificial  satellite  (  Sputnik 1  ) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The  U.S. Congress , alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the \" Sputnik crisis \"), urged immediate and swift action; President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  and his advisers counseled more deliberate measures. This led to an agreement that a new federal agency mainly based on NACA was needed to conduct all non-military activity in space. The  Advanced Research Projects Agency  (ARPA) was created in February 1958 to develop space technology for military application.   [ 13 ]    \n On July 29, 1958, Eisenhower signed the  National Aeronautics and Space Act , establishing NASA. When it began operations on October 1, 1958, NASA absorbed the 46-year-old NACA intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of US$100\u00a0million, three major research laboratories ( Langley Aeronautical Laboratory ,  Ames Aeronautical Laboratory , and  Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory ) and two small test facilities.   [ 14 ]    A  NASA seal  was approved by President Eisenhower in 1959.   [ 15 ]    Elements of the  Army Ballistic Missile Agency  and the  United States Naval Research Laboratory  were incorporated into NASA. A significant contributor to NASA's entry into the  Space Race  with the Soviet Union was the technology from the  German rocket program  led by  Wernher von Braun , who was now working for the  Army Ballistic Missile Agency  (ABMA), which in turn incorporated the technology of American scientist  Robert Goddard 's earlier works.   [ 16 ]    Earlier research efforts within the  U.S. Air Force    [ 14 ]    and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA.   [ 17 ]    In December 1958, NASA gained control of the  Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a contractor facility operated by the  California Institute of Technology .   [ 14 ]    \n  Space flight programs  \n \n    \n \n     \nAt launch control for the May 28, 1964,  Saturn I SA-6 launch .  Wernher von Braun  is at center. \n \n \n Main article:  List of NASA missions  \n The most notable NASA activities are its space flight programs, both manned and unmanned. The latter can be either independent, carrying scientific equipment, or supportive, testing equipment for manned flights. In the beginning, NASA\u2019s missions focused on the space race with the  Soviet Union , which won the first round, but later the United States took the initiative and won the final race to the Moon. The unmanned missions have until now explored most of our solar system. They have also brought  telescopes for deep space exploration  into orbit around the Earth together with satellites for  studying Earth itself . \n  Manned programs  \n The rocket planes experiments started by NACA was taken a step further by NASA which used them as support for spaceflights, the first of which was one-manned and launched by military rockets. When the attention turned to reaching the Moon, the solution chosen was complicated but also the most economical. Supportive projects, both  manned  and  unmanned  were introduced and  bigger rockets  together with  spacecraft and moon lander  developed. The Moon landing and end of the space race meant a reduction of NASA\u2019s activities. Space stations of a more or less permanent nature, suggested already during the space race, were built and an international cooperation was introduced in an attempt to both bring nations together and at the same time share the high costs of space missions. In all, more than 100 manned missions have been made by NASA since 1958.   [ 18 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \n Neil Armstrong  and X-15, 1960 \n \n \n  X-15 rocket plane (1959\u201368)  \n Main article:  North American X-15  \n The NACA XS-1 ( Bell X-1 ) was followed by additional experimental vehicles, including the  X-15  in cooperation with the US Air Force and US Navy. The design featured a slender fuselage with fairings along the side containing fuel and early computerized control systems.   [ 19 ]    When the spacerace began the main objective was to get a person into space as soon as possible, therefore the simplest spacecraft that could be launched by existing rockets was favored. This led to the choice of a small capsule spacecraft while rocket plane proposals like a modified X-15   [ 20 ]    were turned down.   [ 21 ]    Instead X-15 was used for development of techniques and equipment of value for the space missions. This included jets for changing the orientation of a spacecraft, space suits for astronauts and horizon definition for navigation.   [ 22 ]    Nearly 200 flights were made between 1959 and 1968 allowing NASA to collect data vital not only to the spacerace but also the design of the Space Shuttle.   [ 19 ]    The altitude record for X-15 was 354,200 feet (107.96\u00a0km).   [ 22 ]    \n  \n  Project Mercury (1959\u201363)  \n Main article:  Project Mercury  \n \n \n \n Friendship 7, NASA's first manned orbital spaceflight \n \n \n     \n Mercury-Atlas 6 launch on February 20, 1962 \n \n \n     \n Still frame of John Glenn in orbit from camera inside Friendship 7 \n \n \n \n Project Mercury started in 1958 as NASA's inheritance of the U.S. Air Force's  Man In Space Soonest  program objective to make the first single-astronaut flights into Earth orbit. The  first seven astronauts  were selected among candidates from the Navy, Air Force and Marine test pilot programs. On May 5, 1961, astronaut  Alan Shepard  became the first American in space aboard   Freedom\u00a07  , launched by a  Redstone booster  on a 15-minute  ballistic  (suborbital) flight.   [ 23 ]     John Glenn  became the first American to be launched into  orbit  by an  Atlas launch vehicle  on February 20, 1962 aboard   Friendship\u00a07  .   [ 24 ]    Glenn completed three orbits, after which three more orbital flights were made, culminating in  L. Gordon Cooper 's 22-orbit flight   Faith 7  , May 15\u201316, 1963.   [ 25 ]    \n The  Soviet Union  (USSR) competed with Mercury in what was called   the Space Race  , with its own single-pilot spacecraft,  Vostok . They bested the U.S. in getting humans into space soonest, by launching cosmonaut  Yuri Gagarin  into a single Earth orbit aboard in  Vostok 1  in April 1961, one month before Shepard's flight.   [ 26 ]    In August 1962, they achieved an almost four-day record flight with  Andriyan Nikolayev  aboard  Vostok 3 , and also conducted a concurrent  Vostok 4  mission carrying  Pavel Popovich . \n  Project Gemini (1961\u201366)  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe first rendezvous of two spacecraft, achieved by Gemini 6 and 7 \n \n \n Main article:  Project Gemini  \n Based on studies to grow the Mercury spacecraft capabilities to long-duration flights, developing  space rendezvous  techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding  extravehicular activity  (EVA) and  rendezvous  and  docking  to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight,  Gemini 3 , was flown by  Gus Grissom  and  John Young  on March 23, 1965.   [ 27 ]    Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data on the effects of weightlessness on humans.   [ 28 ]      [ 29 ]    \n Under the direction of Soviet Premier  Nikita Khrushchev , the USSR competed with Gemini by converting their Vostok spacecraft into a two- or three-man  Voskhod . They succeeded in launching two manned flights before Gemini's first flight, achieving a three-cosmonaut flight in 1963 and the first EVA in 1964. After this, the program was then canceled, and Gemini caught up while spacecraft designer  Sergei Korolev  developed the  Soyuz spacecraft , their answer to Apollo. \n \n    \n \n     \nSpacecraft and rocket comparison including  Apollo  (biggest), Gemini and Mercury.

Kennedy  to ask the Congress on May 25, 1961 to commit the federal government to a program to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which effectively launched the  Apollo program .   [ 30 ]    \n Apollo was one of the most expensive American scientific programs ever. It is estimated to have cost $203\u00a0billion in present-day US dollars.   [ 31 ]      [ 32 ]    (In comparison, the  Manhattan Project  cost roughly $25.9\u00a0billion, accounting for inflation.)   [ 31 ]      [ 33 ]    It used the  Saturn rockets  as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects.   [ 34 ]    The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth. \n \n    \n \n     \nBuzz Aldrin on the Moon, 1969 \n \n \n The second manned mission,  Apollo 8 , brought astronauts for the first time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968.   [ 35 ]    Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an unmanned spacecraft around the Moon.   [ 36 ]    On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced   [ 37 ]      [ 38 ]    and then finally the Moon landing was made on the  Apollo 11  mission in July 1969.   [ 39 ]    \n The first  person to stand on the Moon  was  Neil Armstrong , who was followed by  Buzz Aldrin , while  Michael Collins  orbited above. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. Throughout these six Apollo spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon. These missions returned a wealth of scientific data and 381.7 kilograms (842\u00a0lb) of lunar samples. Topics covered by experiments performed included  soil mechanics ,  meteoroids ,  seismology ,  heat flow ,  lunar ranging ,  magnetic fields , and  solar wind .   [ 40 ]    The Moon landing marked the end of the space race and as a gesture, Armstrong mentioned mankind   [ 41 ]    when he stepped down on the Moon. \n \n    \n \n     \nApollo 17's lunar roving vehicle, 1972 \n \n \n Apollo set major  milestones  in human spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond  low Earth orbit , and landing humans on another  celestial body .   [ 42 ]     Apollo 8  was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while  Apollo 17  marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond  low Earth orbit . The program spurred advances in many areas of technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including  avionics , telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the  Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums . \n  Skylab (1965\u201379)  \n \n    \n \n     \nSkylab space station, 1974 \n \n \n Main article:  Skylab  \n Skylab was the United States' first and only independently built  space station .   [ 43 ]    Conceived in 1965 as a workshop to be constructed in space from a spent  Saturn IB  upper stage, the 169,950\u00a0lb (77,088\u00a0kg) station was constructed on Earth and launched on May 14, 1973 atop the first two stages of a  Saturn V , into a 235-nautical-mile (435\u00a0km) orbit inclined at 50\u00b0 to the equator. Damaged during launch by the loss of its thermal protection and one electricity-generating solar panel, it was repaired to functionality by its first crew. It was occupied for a total of 171 days by 3 successive crews in 1973 and 1974.   [ 43 ]    It included a laboratory for studying the effects of  microgravity , and a  solar observatory .   [ 43 ]    NASA planned to have a Space Shuttle dock with it, and elevate Skylab to a higher safe altitude, but the Shuttle was not ready for flight before Skylab's re-entry on July 11, 1979.   [ 44 ]    \n To save cost, NASA used one of the Saturn V rockets originally earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts to and from the Skylab. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. Skylab's habitable volume was 11,290 cubic feet (320\u00a0m 3 ), which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the  Apollo Command Module .   [ 44 ]    \n  Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1972\u201375)  \n \n    \n \n     \nApollo-Soyuz crews with models of spacecraft, 1975 \n \n \n Main article:  Apollo-Soyuz Test Project  \n On May 24, 1972, US President  Richard M. Nixon  and  Soviet  Premier  Alexei Kosygin  signed an agreement calling for a joint manned space mission, and declaring intent for all future international manned spacecraft to be capable of docking with each other.   [ 45 ]    This authorized the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), involving the rendezvous and docking in Earth orbit of a surplus  Apollo Command/Service Module  with a  Soyuz  spacecraft. The mission took place in July 1975. This was the last US manned space flight until the first orbital flight of the  Space Shuttle  in April 1981.   [ 46 ]    \n The mission included both joint and separate scientific experiments, and provided useful engineering experience for future joint US\u2013Russian space flights, such as the Shuttle\u2013Mir Program   [ 47 ]    and the International Space Station. \n  Space Shuttle program (1972\u20132011)  \n Main article:  Space Shuttle program  \n \n \n \n     \n Discovery liftoff, 2008 \n \n \n     \n Mission profile. Left: launch, top: orbit (cargo bay open), right: reentry and landing \n \n \n \n The  Space Shuttle  became the major focus of NASA in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Planned as a frequently launchable and mostly reusable vehicle, four space shuttle orbiters were built by 1985. The first to launch,   Columbia  , did so on April 12, 1981,   [ 48 ]    the 20th anniversary of the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin.   [ 49 ]    \n Its major components were a  spaceplane  orbiter with an external fuel tank and two solid fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which was bigger than the spacecraft itself, was the only component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185\u2013643\u00a0km (115\u2013400  miles )   [ 50 ]    and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400\u00a0kg (54,000\u00a0lb).   [ 51 ]    Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.   [ 50 ]    \n On 20 missions (1983\u201398) the Space Shuttle carried  Spacelab , designed in cooperation with the  ESA . Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an  airlock .   [ 52 ]    Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble space telescope 1990 and 1993   [ 53 ]    \n In 1995 Russian-American interaction resumed with the  Shuttle-Mir  missions (1995\u20131998). Once more an American vehicle docked with a Russian craft, this time a full-fledged space station. This cooperation has continued with Russia and the United States as the two of the biggest partners in the largest space station built: the  International Space Station  (ISS). The strength of their cooperation on this project was even more evident when NASA began relying on Russian launch vehicles to service the ISS during the two-year grounding of the shuttle fleet following the 2003  Space Shuttle  Columbia  disaster . \n The Shuttle fleet lost two orbiters and 14 astronauts in two disasters:   Challenger   in 1986, and  Columbia  in 2003.   [ 54 ]    While the 1986 loss was mitigated by building the  Space Shuttle  Endeavour   from replacement parts, NASA did not build another orbiter to replace the  second loss .   [ 54 ]    NASA's Space Shuttle program had 135 missions when the program ended with the successful landing of the Space Shuttle Atlantis at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011. The program spanned 30 years with over 300 astronauts sent into space.   [ 55 ]    \n  International Space Station (1993\u2013present)  \n Main article:  International Space Station  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe International Space Station \n \n \n The International Space Station (ISS) combines NASA's   Space Station Freedom   project with the Soviet/Russian   Mir-2   station, the European   Columbus   station, and the Japanese  Kib\u014d  laboratory module.   [ 56 ]    NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop  Freedom  alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the  Russian Federal Space Agency  (RKA), the  Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency  (JAXA), the  European Space Agency  (ESA), and the  Canadian Space Agency  (CSA).   [ 57 ]      [ 58 ]    The station consists of pressurized modules, external  trusses ,  solar arrays  and other components, which have been launched by Russian  Proton  and  Soyuz  rockets, and the US Space Shuttles.   [ 56 ]    It is  currently being assembled  in  Low Earth Orbit . The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the  US Orbital Segment  occurred in 2011 and the completion of the  Russian Orbital Segment  is expected by 2016.   [ 59 ]      [ 60 ]    The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements   [ 61 ]    which divide the station into two areas and allow  Russia  to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of Zarya),   [ 62 ]      [ 63 ]    with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.   [ 61 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  STS-131  (light blue) and  Expedition 23  (dark blue) crew members in April 2010. \n \n \n Long duration missions to the ISS are referred to as  ISS Expeditions . Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.   [ 64 ]    The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the Columbia disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.   [ 65 ]    Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.   [ 66 ]    The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past  7001130000000000000 13\u00a0years and  7001780000000000000 78\u00a0days, having exceeded the previous record held by  Mir ; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from  15 different nations .   [ 67 ]      [ 68 ]    The station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2013  [update]  , is the largest artificial satellite in  Earth  orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.   [ 69 ]    The  Soyuz  spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian  Progress spacecraft  which has done so since 2000, the European  Automated Transfer Vehicle  (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese  H-II Transfer Vehicle  (HTV) since 2009, the American  Dragon spacecraft  since 2012 and the American  Cygnus spacecraft  since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the  International Space Station  exclusively aboard the Soyuz.   [ 70 ]    The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.   [ 71 ]    \n The ISS program is expected to continue until at least 2020 but may be extended until 2028 or possibly beyond that.   [ 72 ]    \n  Commercial Resupply Services (2006-present)  \n Main article:  Commercial Resupply Services  \n \n \n \n     \n The Dragon is seen being berthed to the ISS in May 2012 \n \n \n     \n The Standard variant of Cygnus is seen berthed to the ISS in September 2013 \n \n \n \n The development of the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) vehicles began in 2006 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS.   [ 73 ]    The development of these vehicles was under a fixed price milestone-based program, meaning that each company that received a funded award had a list of milestones with a dollar value attached to them that they didn't receive until after they had successful completed the milestone.   [ 74 ]    Private companies were also required to have some \"skin in the game\" which refers raising an unspecified amount of private investment for their proposal.   [ 75 ]    \n On 23 December 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services contracts to  SpaceX  and  Orbital Sciences Corporation .   [ 76 ]    SpaceX uses its  Falcon 9  rocket and  Dragon spacecraft .   [ 77 ]    Orbital Sciences uses its  Antares  rocket and  Cygnus spacecraft . The  first Dragon resupply mission  occurred in May 2012.   [ 78 ]    The  first Cygnus resupply mission  occurred in September 2013.   [ 79 ]    The CRS program now provides for all America's ISS cargo needs; with the exception of a few vehicle-specific payloads that are delivered on the European  ATV  and the Japanese  HTV .   [ 80 ]    \n  Commercial Crew Program (2010\u2013present)  \n Main article:  Commercial Crew Development  \n The  Commercial Crew Development  (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth.   [ 81 ]      [ 81 ]    It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by  Bigelow Aerospace .   [ 82 ]    Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.   [ 74 ]    \n In 2010, NASA announced the winners of the first phase of the program, a total of $50\u00a0million was divided among five American companies to foster research and development into human spaceflight concepts and technologies in the private sector. In 2011, the winners of the second phase of the program were announced, $270\u00a0million was divided among four companies.   [ 83 ]    In 2012, the winners of the third phase of the program were announced, NASA provided $1.1 billion divided among three companies to further develop their crew transportation systems.   [ 84 ]    This phase of the CCDev program is expected to last from 3 June 2012 to 31 May 2014.   [ 84 ]    The winners of this latest round were SpaceX's  Dragon  planned to be launched on a  Falcon 9 , Boeing's  CST-100  planned to be launched on an  Atlas V  and Sierra Nevada's  Dream Chaser , which is also planned to be launched on an Atlas V.   [ 85 ]    NASA will most likely only choose one provider for the Commercial Crew program, this vehicle is expected by NASA to become operational around 2017.   [ 86 ]      [ 87 ]    \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n The unmanned variant of Dragon is seen approaching the ISS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n Computer rendering of CST-100 in orbit \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n Dream Chaser atmospheric test article \n \n \n \n \n  Beyond Low Earth Orbit program (2010\u2013present)  \n \n    \n \n     \nArtist's rendering of the 70 mt variant of SLS launching Orion \n \n \n For missions beyond  low Earth orbit  (BLEO), NASA has been directed to develop the  Space Launch System  (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft,  Orion . In February 2010, President  Barack Obama 's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the  Constellation program  and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies.   [ 88 ]    During speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed the design selection of the new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) that would replace the formerly planned  Ares V  should be delayed until 2015.   [ 89 ]    He also proposed that the United States should send a crew to an asteroid in the 2020s and send a crew to Mars orbit in the mid-2030s.   [ 89 ]    The  U.S. Congress  drafted the  NASA Authorization Act of 2010  and President Obama signed it into law on October 11 of that year.   [ 90 ]    The authorization act officially canceled the Constellation program.   [ 90 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nOrion spacecraft design as of January 2013 \n \n \n The Authorization Act required a new HLV design to be chosen within 90 days of its passing and for the construction of a beyond low earth orbit spacecraft.   [ 91 ]    The authorization act called this new HLV the Space Launch System. The authorization act also required a beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft to be developed, the  Orion spacecraft , which was being developed as part of the Constellation program, was chosen to fulfill this role.   [ 92 ]    The Space Launch System is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware for missions beyond low Earth orbit.   [ 93 ]    The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. The initial capability of SLS is required to be able to lift 70 mt into  LEO , it is then planned to be upgraded to 105 mt and then eventually to 130 mt.   [ 92 ]      [ 94 ]    \n  Exploration Flight Test 1  (EFT-1), an unmanned test flight of Orion's crew module, is planned to be launched in 2014 on a  Delta IV Heavy  rocket.   [ 94 ]     Exploration Mission-1  (EM-1) is the unmanned initial launch of SLS that would also send Orion on a  circumlunar trajectory , which is planned for 2017.   [ 94 ]    The first manned flight of Orion and SLS, Exploration Mission 2 (EM-2) is to launch between 2019 and 2021; it is a 10- to 14-day mission planned to place a crew of four into  Lunar orbit .   [ 94 ]    As of March 2012, the destination for EM-3 and the intermediate focus for this new program is still in-flux.   [ 95 ]    \n  Unmanned programs  \n \n    \n \n     \nDeep space mission deployed by Shuttle, 1989 \n \n \n Main article:  Unmanned NASA missions  \n More than 1,000 unmanned missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the solar system.   [ 96 ]    Besides exploration, communication satellites have also been launched by NASA.   [ 97 ]    The missions have been launched directly from Earth or from orbiting space shuttles, which could either deploy the satellite itself, or with a rocket stage to take it farther. \n The first US unmanned satellite was  Explorer 1 , which started as an ABMA/JPL project during the early space race. It was launched in January 1958, two months after Sputnik. At the creation of NASA the Explorer project was transferred to this agency and still continues to this day. Its missions have been focusing on the Earth and the Sun, measuring magnetic fields and the  solar wind , among other aspects.   [ 98 ]    A more recent Earth mission, not related to the Explorer program, was the  Hubble Space Telescope , which as mentioned above was brought into orbit in 1990.   [ 99 ]    \n The  inner Solar System  has been made the goal of at least four unmanned programs. The first was  Mariner  in the 1960s and 70s, which made multiple visits to  Venus  and  Mars  and one to  Mercury . Probes launched under the Mariner program were also the first to make a planetary flyby ( Mariner 2 ), to take the first pictures from another planet ( Mariner 4 ), the first planetary orbiter ( Mariner 9 ), and the first to make a  gravity assist  maneuver ( Mariner 10 ). This is a technique where the satellite takes advantage of the gravity and velocity of planets to reach its destination.   [ 100 ]    \n The first successful landing on Mars was made by  Viking 1  in 1976. Twenty years later a rover was landed on Mars by  Mars Pathfinder .   [ 101 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nUranus by   Voyager 2  , 1986 \n \n \n Outside Mars, Jupiter was first visited by  Pioneer 10  in 1973. More than 20 years later   Galileo   sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, and became the first spacecraft to orbit the planet.   [ 102 ]     Pioneer 11  became the first spacecraft to visit  Saturn  in 1979, with  Voyager 2  making the first (and so far only) visits to  Uranus  and  Neptune  in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983.   [ 103 ]    For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both  Voyager 1  and  Voyager 2 .   [ 104 ]    \n Pioneers 10 and 11 and both Voyager probes carry messages from the Earth to extraterrestrial life.   [ 105 ]      [ 106 ]    A problem with deep space travel is communication. For instance, it takes about 3 hours at present for a radio signal to reach the New Horizons spacecraft at a point more than halfway to Pluto.   [ 107 ]    Contact with Pioneer 10 was lost in 2003. Both Voyager probes continue to operate as they explore the outer boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.   [ 108 ]    \n On November 26, 2011, NASA's  Mars Science Laboratory  mission was successfully launched for Mars.   Curiosity   successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.   [ 109 ]      [ 110 ]      [ 111 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nThe NROL-39 GEMSat mission lifted off from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Dec. 5, 2013, aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nArtist's concept of the Intelligent Payload Experiment (IPEX) and M-Cubed/COVE-2, two NASA Earth-orbiting cube satellites (\"CubeSats\") that were launched as part of the NROL-39 GEMSat mission from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Dec. 5, 2013. \n \n \n  Recent and planned activities  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe Orion spacecraft is intended to be used for beyond low Earth orbit missions, shown here is the ground test article \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \n  Curiosity  's wheel on  Mars , 2012 \n \n \n NASA's ongoing investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars and Saturn and studies of the Earth and the Sun. Other active spacecraft missions are  MESSENGER  for  Mercury , New Horizons (for Jupiter,  Pluto , and beyond), and  Dawn  for the  asteroid belt . NASA continued to support   in situ   exploration beyond the asteroid belt, including Pioneer and Voyager traverses into the unexplored trans-Pluto region, and  Gas Giant  orbiters Galileo (1989\u20132003), Cassini (1997\u2013), and Juno (2011\u2013). \n The  New Horizons  mission to Pluto was launched in 2006 and is currently en route for a  Pluto  flyby in 2015. The probe received a  gravity assist  from  Jupiter  in February 2007, examining some of Jupiter's inner moons and testing on-board instruments during the flyby. On the horizon of NASA's plans is the  MAVEN  spacecraft as part of the  Mars Scout Program  to study the  atmosphere of Mars .   [ 112 ]    \n On December 4, 2006, NASA announced it was planning a  permanent moon base .   [ 113 ]    The goal was to start building the moon base by 2020, and by 2024, have a fully functional base that would allow for crew rotations and  in-situ resource utilization . However in 2009, the  Augustine Committee  found the program to be on a \"unsustainable trajectory.\"   [ 114 ]    In 2010, President  Barack Obama  halted existing plans, including the Moon base, and directed a generic focus on manned missions to asteroids and Mars, as well as extending support for the  International Space Station .   [ 115 ]    \n Since 2011, NASA's strategic goals have been   [ 116 ]    \n \n Extend and sustain  human activities  across the  solar system  \n Expand scientific understanding of the Earth and the universe \n Create innovative new space  technologies  \n Advance  aeronautics  research \n Enable program and institutional capabilities to conduct NASA's aeronautics and space activities \n Share NASA with the public, educators, and students to provide opportunities to participate \n \n In August 2011, NASA accepted the donation of  two space telescopes  from the  National Reconnaissance Office . Despite being stored unused, the instruments are superior to the  Hubble Space Telescope .   [ 117 ]    \n In September 2011, NASA announced the start of the  Space Launch System  program to develop a human-rated heavy lift vehicle. The Space Launch System is intended to launch the  Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle  and other elements towards the  Moon ,  near-Earth asteroids , and one day  Mars .   [ 118 ]    The Orion MPCV is planned for an unmanned test launch on a  Delta IV Heavy  rocket around late 2013.   [ 119 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nCelebration erupts at NASA with the successful landing of Curiosity on Mars \n \n \n On August 6, 2012, NASA landed the rover   Curiosity   on Mars. On August 27, 2012,  Curiosity  transmitted the first pre-recorded message from the surface of Mars back to Earth, made by Administrator Charlie Bolden: \n \n Hello. This is Charlie Bolden, NASA Administrator, speaking to you via the broadcast capabilities of the Curiosity Rover, which is now on the surface of Mars. \n Since the beginning of time, humankind\u2019s curiosity has led us to constantly seek new life\u2026new possibilities just beyond the horizon. I want to congratulate the men and women of our NASA family as well as our commercial and government partners around the world, for taking us a step beyond to Mars. \n This is an extraordinary achievement. Landing a rover on Mars is not easy \u2013 others have tried \u2013 only America has fully succeeded. The investment we are making\u2026the knowledge we hope to gain from our observation and analysis of Gale Crater, will tell us much about the possibility of life on Mars as well as the past and future possibilities for our own planet. Curiosity will bring benefits to Earth and inspire a new generation of scientists and explorers, as it prepares the way for a human mission in the not too distant future. Thank you.

Prominent among these is the  Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity  Study, in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders  Leroy Chiao  and  Gennady Padalka ) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space. Usually there is no physician on board the  International Space Station , and  diagnosis of medical conditions  is challenging. Astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including  decompression sickness , barotrauma, immunodeficiencies, loss of bone and muscle, orthostatic intolerance due to volume loss,  sleep disturbances , and radiation injury.  Ultrasound  offers a unique opportunity to monitor these conditions in space. This study's techniques are now being applied to cover professional and Olympic sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by non-expert operators in populations such as medical and high school students. It is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations, where access to a trained physician is often rare.   [ 121 ]      [ 122 ]      [ 123 ]    \n  Ozone depletion  \n In 1975, NASA was directed by legislation to research and monitor the upper atmosphere. This led to Upper Atmosphere Research Program and later the  Earth Observing System  (EOS) satellites in the 1990s to monitor  ozone depletion .   [ 124 ]    The first comprehensive worldwide measurements were obtained in 1978 with the Nimbus 7 satellite and NASA scientists at the  Goddard Institute for Space Studies .   [ 125 ]    \n  Salt evaporation and energy management  \n In one of the nation's largest restoration projects, NASA technology helps state and federal government reclaim 15,100 acres (61\u00a0km 2 ) of salt evaporation ponds in South San Francisco Bay. Satellite sensors are used by scientists to study the effect of salt evaporation on local ecology.   [ 126 ]    \n NASA has started Energy Efficiency and Water Conservation Program as an agency-wide program directed to prevent pollution and reduce energy and water utilization. It helps to ensure that NASA meets its federal stewardship responsibilities for the environment.

NASA currently has more than a dozen Earth science spacecraft/instruments in orbit studying all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere,  biosphere ,  cryosphere ), with several more planned for launch in the next few years.   [ 128 ]    \n NASA is working in cooperation with  National Renewable Energy Laboratory  (NREL). The goal is to produce worldwide solar resource maps with great local detail.   [ 129 ]    NASA was also one of the main participants in the evaluation innovative technologies for the clean up of the sources for  dense non-aqueous phase liquids  (DNAPLs). On April 6, 1999, the agency signed The  Memorandum of Agreement  (MOA) along with the  United States Environmental Protection Agency ,  DOE , and  USAF  authorizing all the above organizations to conduct necessary tests at the John F. Kennedy Space center. The main purpose was to evaluate two innovative in-situ remediation technologies, thermal removal and oxidation destruction of DNAPLs.   [ 130 ]    National Space Agency made a partnership with Military Services and  Defense Contract Management Agency  named the \u201cJoint Group on Pollution Prevention\u201d. The group is working on reduction or elimination of hazardous materials or processes.   [ 131 ]    \n On May 8, 2003,  Environmental Protection Agency  recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use  landfill gas  to produce energy at one of its facilities\u2014the  Goddard Space Flight Center , Greenbelt, Maryland.   [ 132 ]    \n  Staff and leadership  \n Main article:  List of NASA Administrators  \n  NASA's administrator  is the agency's highest-ranking official and serves as the senior space science adviser to the President of the United States. The agency's administration is located at  NASA Headquarters  in Washington, DC and provides overall guidance and direction.   [ 133 ]    Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be  citizens of the United States .   [ 134 ]    \n The first administrator was Dr.  T. Keith Glennan , appointed by President  Dwight D. Eisenhower ; during his term he brought together the disparate projects in space development research in the US.   [ 135 ]    \n The third administrator was  James E. Webb  (served 1961\u20131968), appointed by President  John F. Kennedy . In order to implement the  Apollo program  to achieve Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon by 1970, Webb directed major management restructuring and facility expansion, establishing the Houston Manned Spacecraft (Johnson) Center and the Florida Launch Operations (Kennedy) Center. \n In 2009, President  Barack Obama  nominated  Charles Bolden  as NASA's twelfth administrator.   [ 136 ]    \n Three NASA administrators,  Richard H. Truly  (served 1989\u20131992),  Frederick D. Gregory  (acting, 2005) and Bolden, have been former astronauts. \n  Facilities  \n \n \n \n     \n  Jet Propulsion Laboratory  complex in Pasadena, California \n \n \n     \n Vehicle Assembly and Launch Control at  Kennedy Space Center  \n \n \n \n Main article:  NASA facilities  \n NASA's facilities are research, construction and communication centers to help its missions. Some facilities serve more than one application for historic or administrative reasons. NASA also operates a short-line  railroad at the Kennedy Space Center  and own special aircraft for instance two  Boeing 747 which were used for transport  of the Space Shuttle orbiter. \n John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), is one of the best-known NASA facilities. It has been the launch site for every United States human space flight since 1968. Although such flights are currently on pause, KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three pads at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \n Another major facility is  Marshall Space Flight Center  in Huntsville, Alabama at which the Saturn 5 rocket and Skylab were developed.   [ 137 ]    The  JPL , mentioned above, was together with  ABMA  one of the agencies behind  Explorer 1 , the first American space mission. \n  Budget  \n \n    \n \n     \nNASA's budget 1962\u20132014 as\u00a0% of federal budget peaking 1966 \n \n \n Main article:  Budget of NASA  \n NASA's budget has generally been approximately 1% of the federal budget from the early 1970s on, but briefly peaked to approximately 4.41% in 1966 during the Apollo program.   [ 138 ]    Recent public perception of the NASA budget has been shown to be significantly different from reality; a 1997 poll indicated that Americans responded on average that 20% of the federal budget went to NASA.   [ 139 ]    \n The percentage of federal budget that NASA has been allocated has been steadily dropping since the Apollo program and as of 2012 the NASA budget is estimated to be 0.48% of the federal budget.   [ 140 ]    In a March 2012 meeting of the  United States Senate Science Committee ,  Neil deGrasse Tyson  testified that \"Right now, NASA\u2019s annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that\u2014a penny on a dollar\u2014we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.\"   [ 141 ]      [ 142 ]    Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, the  Penny4NASA  nonprofit was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget, or one \"penny on the dollar.\"   [ 143 ]    \n  Current missions  \n \n    \n \n     \nVarious nebulae observed from a NASA space telescope \n \n \n Examples of some current NASA missions: \n \n  2001 Mars Odyssey , Mars orbiter \n  Cassini , Saturn orbiter \n  Chandra X-ray Telescope  \n  Curiosity rover  ( Mars Science Laboratory ), Mars rover \n  Dawn , asteroid orbiter \n  Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope  \n  Hubble Space Telescope  \n  International Space Station  \n  Kepler mission  \n  Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , Lunar orbiter \n  MESSENGER , Mercury orbiter \n  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , Mars orbiter \n  New Horizons , Pluto flyby \n  Opportunity rover , Mars rover \n  Solar Dynamics Observatory  \n  Spitzer Space Telescope  \n  STEREO  \n  Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission  \n \n  See also  \n \n \n \n     \n  Government of the United States portal  \n \n \n     \n  Spaceflight portal  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Aerospace Education Services Project  \n  Astronomy Picture of the Day  \n  Astrotech Corporation  \n  Buran , Soviet space shuttle \n  Department of Defense Manned Space Flight Support Office  \n  Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP Federation)  \n  List of aerospace engineering topics  \n  List of NASA aircraft  \n  List of NASA missions  \n  List of rockets used by NASA  \n  NASA Acquisition Internet Service  \n  NASA Advanced Space Transportation Program  \n  NASA awards and decorations  \n  NASAcast  \n  NASA insignia  \n  NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge  \n  NASA Research Park  \n  NASA spin-off  \n  NASA TV  \n  Project A119  \n  Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee  \n  Saturn (rocket family)  \n  Scientific research on the ISS  \n  Small Explorer program  \n  Spacelab  \n  Space policy of the Barack Obama administration  \n  Space probe  \n  Space race  \n  Starlite , a  MMO  game by NASA \n  Timeline of Solar System exploration  \n  Unmanned spacecraft  \n  Vision for Space Exploration  \n \n \n  References  \n \n \n    ^      Lale Tayla and Figen Bingul (2007).  \"NASA stands \"for the benefit of all.\"\u2014Interview with NASA's Dr. S\u00fcleyman Gokoglu\" .

ESTEC was the main technical centre of ESRO and remains so for the successor organization, ESA \n \n \n After  World War II , many European scientists left  Western Europe  in order to work in the  United States . Although the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in space related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after the  Sputnik shock ,  Edoardo Amaldi  and  Pierre Auger , two prominent members of the western European scientific community at that time, met to discuss the foundation of a common western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries, including  Harrie Massey  (UK). \n The Western European nations decided to have two different agencies, one concerned with developing a launch system  ELDO  (European Launch Development Organization) and the precursor of the European Space Agency,  ESRO  (European Space Research Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO carried out numerous successful projects. Seven research satellites were brought into orbit, all by US launch systems. Ariane did not exist at that time. \n ESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with  ELDO . ESA has 10 founding member states:  Belgium ,  Denmark ,  France ,  Germany ,  Italy , the  Netherlands ,  Spain ,  Sweden ,  Switzerland  and the  United Kingdom .   [ 3 ]    These signed the ESA Convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention came into force. During this interval the agency functioned in a  de facto  fashion.   [ 2 ]    ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975,  Cos-B , a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe first worked on by ESRO. \n  End of space race   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nMock-up of the  Ariane 1  \n \n \n Beginning in the 1970s, when the  space race  between the US and the Soviet Union had cooled down and space budgets were cut dramatically in both countries, ESA established itself as a frontrunner in space exploration. [   citation needed   ]  ESA joined NASA in the  IUE , the world's first high-orbit  telescope , which was launched in 1978 and operated very successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 ESA began  Giotto , its first deep-space mission, to study the Comets  Halley  and  Grigg-Skjellerup .  Hipparcos , a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s  SOHO ,  Ulysses  and the  Hubble Space Telescope  were all jointly carried out with  NASA . Recent scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include the  Cassini\u2013Huygens  space probe, to which ESA contributed by building the  Titan  landing module  Huygens . \n As the successor of  ELDO , ESA has also constructed rockets for unmanned scientific and commercial payloads.  Ariane 1 , launched in 1979, brought mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two developments of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, the  Ariane 4 , which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established ESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding  Ariane 5  experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 56 successful launches as of September 2011. The successor launch vehicle of  Ariane 5 , the  Ariane 6  is already in the definition stage and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s. \n The beginning of the new millennium saw ESA become, along with agencies like  NASA ,  JAXA ,  ISRO ,  CSA  and  Roscosmos , one of the major participants in scientific  space research . While ESA had relied on cooperation with NASA in previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the  United States military ) led to decisions to rely more on itself and on cooperation with Russia. A 2011 press issue thus stated:   [ 4 ]    \n \n Russia is ESA's first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space. There is a framework agreement between ESA and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and cooperation is already under way in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners. \n \n Most notable for its new self-confidence are ESA's own recent successful missions  SMART-1 , a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology, the  Mars Express  and  Venus Express  missions as well as the development of the  Ariane 5  rocket and its role in the  ISS  partnership. ESA maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as  Corot , launched on 27 December 2006, a milestone in the search for  extrasolar planets . \n  Mission statement   [  edit  ]   \n Since the  Cold War  ended with the fall of the  Soviet Union 's \" iron curtain \",  space agencies  around the world had to refocus and revise their visions and goals. During an interview with  JAXA , the Japanese national space agency,  Jean-Jacques Dordain  ESA's Director General (since 2003) outlined briefly the European Space Agency's mission:   [ 5 ]    \n \n Today space activities are pursued for the benefit of citizens, and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on earth. They want greater security and economic wealth, but they also want to pursue their dreams, to increase their knowledge, and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology. \n I think that space can do all of this: it can produce a higher quality of life, better security, more economic wealth, and also fulfill our citizens' dreams and thirst for knowledge, and attract the young generation. This is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities. It has always been so, and it will be even more important in the future. \n \n Article II, Purpose, Convention of establishment of a European Space Agency, SP-1271(E) from 2003 also defines ESA's mission statement:   [ 6 ]    \n \n ESA's purpose shall be to provide for, and to promote, for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among European States in space research and technology and their space applications, with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems: \n \n by elaborating and implementing a long-term European space policy, by recommending space objectives to the Member States, and by concerting the policies of the Member States with respect to other national and international organisations and institutions; \n by elaborating and implementing activities and programmes in the space field; \n by coordinating the European space programme and national programmes, and by integrating the latter progressively and as completely as possible into the European space programme, in particular as regards the development of applications satellites; \n by elaborating and implementing the industrial policy appropriate to its programme and by recommending a coherent industrial policy to the Member States. \n \n \n  Member states and budget   [  edit  ]   \n  Membership and contribution to ESA   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n  \u00a0 \u00a0Member states \n  \u00a0 \u00a0ECS states \n  \u00a0 \u00a0Signatories of the Cooperation Agreement \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \n  \u00a0 \u00a0ESA member states \n  \u00a0 \u00a0ESA associate members \n  \u00a0 \u00a0ECS states \n  \u00a0 \u00a0Signatories of the Cooperation Agreement \n \n \n \n ESA is an intergovernmental organisation of 20 member states.

[ 11 ]    Every 3\u20134 years, ESA member states agree on a budget plan for several years at an ESA member states conference. This plan can be amended in future years, however provides the major guideline for ESA for several years. The last major conference was held at the end of 2008, setting the budget for the years to 2012. \n The 2011 funding allocations for major areas of ESA activity are shown on the pie-chart on the right. The section called 'Other' includes Technology Development, Space Situational Awareness and spending related to European Cooperating States.   [ 25 ]    \n Countries typically have their own space programmes that differ in how they operate organisationally and financially with ESA. For example, the French space agency CNES has a total budget of \u20ac2015 million, of which \u20ac755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to ESA.   [ 28 ]    Several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and ESA (e.g.  COROT ). Also, ESA is not the only European space organisation (for example  European Union Satellite Centre ). \n  Enlargement   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  Enlargement of the European Space Agency  \n After the decision of the ESA Council of 21/22 March 2001, the procedure for accession of the  European states  was detailed as described here.   [ 29 ]    Nations who want to become a full member of ESA do so in 3 stages. First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to cooperate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's space industry capacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter.   [ 30 ]    ESA is likely to expand quite rapidly in the coming years. Many countries, most of which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007, have started to cooperate with ESA on various levels: \n \n \n Applicant state \n Cooperation Agreement \n ECS Agreement \n PECS Charter(s) \n ESA Convention \n National Programme \n \n \n   \u00a0  Hungary  \n  01991-04-01  April 1991    [ 31 ]      [ 32 ]    \n  02003-04-07  7 April 2003    [ 33 ]    \n 1st: 5 November 2003   [ 34 ]    \n2nd: 26 September 2008   [ 35 ]    \n 2013 or later   [ 36 ]      [ 37 ]    \n  HSO  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Turkey  \n  02004-07-15  15 July 2004    [ 38 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n  T\u00dcB\u0130TAK  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Estonia  \n  02007-06-26  26 June 2007    [ 39 ]    \n  02009-11-10  10 November 2009    [ 40 ]    \n 22 September 2010    [ 41 ]    \n  \n through  MoEC  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Ukraine  \n  02008-01-25  25 January 2008    [ 42 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n  SSAU  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Slovenia  \n  02008-05-28  28 May 2008    [ 43 ]    \n  02010-01-22  22 January 2010    [ 44 ]    \n  02010-11-30  30 November 2010    [ 45 ]    \n  \n through  MoHEST  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Latvia  \n  02009-07-23  23 July 2009    [ 46 ]    \n  02013-03-19  19 March 2013    [ 47 ]    \n  \n  \n through  MoES  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Cyprus  \n  02009-08-27  27 August 2009    [ 48 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n through  MoCW  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Slovakia     [ 49 ]    \n  02010-04-28  28 April 2010    [ 50 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n through  MoE  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Lithuania  \n  02010-10-07  7 October 2010    [ 51 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n through  MoE    [ 52 ]    \n \n \n   \u00a0  Israel  \n  02011-01-30  30 January 2011    [ 53 ]      [ 54 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n  ISA  \n \n \n   \u00a0  Malta  \n  02012-02-20  20 February 2012    [ 55 ]    \n  \n  \n  \n through  MCfST .

However, Bulgaria is in the process of signing a Cooperation Agreement. \n   \u00a0  Bulgaria 's progress towards ESA: \n \n On 9 April 2009, the Bulgarian Government announced Bulgaria's intention to participate in the activities of ESA   [ 57 ]    through  IKI-BAN .   [ 58 ]    \n On 21 November 2011, Bulgaria became an official observer of ESA. The observer status that was granted allows Bulgaria to attend the ESA Council meetings for those matters of common interest between ESA and the EU.   [ 59 ]    \n On the same date, Bulgaria entered negotiations with ESA about signing a Cooperation Agreement.   [ 59 ]    \n \n  Launch vehicle fleet   [  edit  ]   \n ESA has a fleet of different launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market. ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs:  Ariane 5 ,  Soyuz-2  and  Vega . Rocket launches are carried out by  Arianespace , which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as  CNES , at the  spaceport  in French Guiana. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher  latitudes . In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500\u00a0m/s due to the higher  rotational velocity  of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero. \n  Ariane 5   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ariane 5  \n \n    \n \n     \nAn  Ariane 5  \n \n \n The Ariane 5 rocket is ESA's primary launcher. Its maximum estimated  payload  is 6-10 tons to  GTO  and up to 21 tons to  LEO . The launch craft has been in service since 1997 and replaced  Ariane 4 . The Ariane 5 rocket exists in several variants, the heaviest being  Ariane 5 ECA , which failed during its first test flight in 2002, but has since made twenty-two consecutive successful flights. \n In November 2012 ESA agreed to build an upgrade of Ariane 5 called Ariane 5ME (Mid-Life Evolution) which will come into service in 2017 holding greater payloads. At the same time, the new engine for the upperstage of 5ME will be part of the Ariane 6 programme; the aim to develop a replacement launcher for Ariane 5. The details and final go-ahead for Ariane 6 will be decided in 2014.   [ 60 ]    \n ESA's  Ariane   1 ,  2 ,  3  and  4  launchers (the last of which was ESA's long-time workhorse) have been retired. \n  Soyuz   [  edit  ]   \n  Soyuz-2  (also called the Soyuz-ST or Soyuz-STK) is a Russian medium  payload  launcher (ca. 3 metric tons to  GTO ) which was brought into ESA service in October 2011.   [ 61 ]      [ 62 ]    ESA entered into a \u20ac340 million joint venture with the  Russian Federal Space Agency  over the use of the Soyuz launcher.   [ 4 ]    Under the agreement, the Russian agency manufactures Soyuz rocket parts for ESA, which are then shipped to French Guiana for assembly. \n ESA benefits because it gains a medium  payload  launcher, complementing its fleet while saving on development costs. In addition, the Soyuz rocket\u2014which has been the Russian's space launch workhorse for some 40 years\u2014is proven technology with a very good safety record. Russia benefits in that it gets access to the Kourou launch site. Launching from Kourou rather than  Baikonur  will allow the Russians to almost double the Soyuz payload (3.0 tonnes vs. 1.7 tonnes to  GTO ), because of Kourou's closer proximity to the equator. Both agencies benefit from the long term strategic cooperation, which is also intended to enable future joint technology developments. [   citation needed   ]  \n The maiden launch from Kourou was on 21 October 2011, for two European space navigation satellites.   [ 63 ]    Three hours and 49 minutes after blast-off, the ESA announced that the two  Galileo   IOV-1 &amp; IOV-2  satellites had successfully reached their final orbit 23,222 kilometres above Earth, and that their launch had been a complete success. The second Soyuz launch from French Guiana on the 16th of December 2011 was also a success. It was followed by another two successful launches from Kourou in 2012, making the first 4 launches with the Soyuz from South America successful. \n  Vega   [  edit  ]   \n   Vega   is ESA's small payload (ca. 1.5 metric tons to 700\u00a0km orbit) launcher.   [ 64 ]    The leading ESA member state for the  Vega  Programme is  Italy , contributing 65% of the costs.  Vega  itself has been designed to be a body launcher [   clarification needed   ]  with three solid propulsion stages and an additional  liquid propulsion   upper module  to place the cargo into the exact orbit intended. For a small-cargo rocket it is remarkable that  Vega  is able to place multiple  payloads  into orbit. \n  Vega' s first and main stage (P80) is a direct modification of the Ariane 5 EAP (solid boosters) developed by CNES, the French space agency.   [ 65 ]    The maiden launch was on 13 February 2012.   [ 66 ]    \n  Human space flight   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n     \n \n  This section is  outdated .  Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.    (July 2011)    \n \n \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Ulf Merbold  became the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. \n \n \n At the time ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight; rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was  Czechoslovak   Vladim\u00edr Remek  who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet European in space (the first European in space being  Yuri Gagarin  of the Soviet Union) \u2014 on a  Soviet   Soyuz spacecraft , followed by the  Pole   Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski  and  East German   Sigmund J\u00e4hn  in the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known as  Intercosmos , primarily involved the participation of  Eastern bloc  countries. In 1982, however,  Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien  became the first  non-Communist Bloc  astronaut on a flight to the Soviet  Salyut 7  space station. \n Because Chr\u00e9tien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the French  CNES  astronaut corps, the German  Ulf Merbold  is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the  STS-9   Space Shuttle  mission that included the first use of the European-built  Spacelab  in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by  ESA  (such as two missions by  Germany  and one by  Japan ) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles, ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with the  Soviet Union  and later  Russia , including numerous visits to  Mir . \n During the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the  European Astronaut Centre  in  Cologne ,  Germany  was established. It selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners, especially with regard to the  International Space Station . As of 2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including nationals from most large European countries except the  United Kingdom . \n In the summer of 2008, the ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of the  European Astronaut Corps  were selected - five men and one woman.

Around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of  Hermes  was introduced. The craft itself was modelled comparable to the first proposals of the  Space Shuttle  and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the  Ariane 5  rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in  Low-Earth orbit  space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; however, the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the  Soviet Union  ESA looked forward to cooperation with  Russia  to build a next-generation human space vehicle. Thus the  Hermes  programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The  Columbus space station programme  had a similar fate. \n In the 21st century ESA started new programmes in order to create its own manned spacecraft, most notable among its various projects and proposals is  Hopper , whose prototype by  EADS , called  Phoenix , has already been tested. While projects such as  Hopper  are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in cooperation with the  Russian Space Agency  have emerged. Following talks with the  Russian Space Agency  in 2004 and June 2005,   [ 72 ]    a cooperation between ESA and the  Russian Space Agency  was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed  Kliper , a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. However, a \u20ac50 million participation study for  Kliper , which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by the ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the  Kliper  project was subsequently cancelled in the summer of 2006. \n In June 2006 ESA member states granted 15 million to the  Crew Space Transportation System  (CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the current  Soyuz  design. This project is pursued with  Roskosmos  instead of the previously cancelled  Kliper  proposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS spacecraft is contemplated for 2008, with the major design decisions being made before the summer of 2007. In mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a \u20ac21 million study into designing a manned variation of the European ATV vehicle which is believed to now be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation System design.   [ 73 ]    \n In November 2012 ESA decided to join NASA's  Orion programme . The ATV would form the basis of a propulsion unit for NASA's new manned spacecraft. ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion's launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.   [ 74 ]    \n  Cooperation with other countries and organisations   [  edit  ]   \n ESA has signed cooperation agreements with the following states that currently neither plan to integrate as tightly with ESA institutions as  Canada , nor envision future membership of ESA:  Argentina ,   [ 75 ]     Brazil ,   [ 76 ]     China ,   [ 77 ]     India    [ 78 ]    (for the  Chandrayan  mission), and  Russia .   [ 33 ]    \n Additionally, ESA has joint projects with the  European Union ,  NASA  of the  United States  and is participating in the  International Space Station  together with the  United States  (NASA),  Russia  and  Japan  (JAXA). \n  European Union   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n  \u00a0 \u00a0ESA and EU member states \n  \u00a0 \u00a0ESA-only members \n  \u00a0 \u00a0EU-only members \n \n \n \n ESA is not an agency or body of the  European Union  (EU), and has non-EU countries  Switzerland  and  Norway  as members. There are however ties between the two, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to define the legal status of ESA with regard to the EU.   [ 24 ]    \n There are common goals between the ESA and the EU. The ESA has an EU liaison office in Brussels. On certain projects, the EU and ESA cooperate, such as the upcoming  Galileo  satellite navigation system. Space policy has since December 2009 been an area for voting in the  European Council . Under the  European Space Policy of 2007 , the EU, ESA and its Member States committed themselves to increasing coordination of their activities and programmes and to organising their respective roles relating to space.   [ 79 ]    \n The Lisbon Treaty of 2009 reinforces the case for space in Europe and strengthens the role of ESA as an R&amp;D space agency. Article 189 of the Treaty gives the EU a mandate to elaborate a European space policy and take related measures, and provides that the EU should establish appropriate relations with ESA. \n Former Italian astronaut  Umberto Guidoni , during his tenure as a  Member of the European Parliament  from 2004 to 2009, stressed the importance of the European Union as a driving force for space exploration, \"since other players are coming up such as India and China it is becoming ever more important that Europeans can have an independent access to space. We have to invest more into space research and technology in order to have an industry capable of competing with other international players.\"   [ 80 ]    \n The first EU-ESA International Conference on Human Space Exploration took place in Prague on 22 and 23 October 2009.   [ 81 ]    A road map which would lead to a common vision and strategic planning in the area of space exploration was discussed. Ministers from all 29 EU and ESA members as well as members of parliament were in attendance.   [ 82 ]    \n  National space organisations of member states   [  edit  ]   \n \n The   Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales   (CNES) (National Centre for Space Study) is the French government space agency (administratively, a \"public establishment of industrial and commercial character\"). Its headquarters are in central  Paris . CNES is the main participant on the Ariane project. Indeed CNES designed and tested all Ariane family rockets (mainly from its centre in  \u00c9vry  near  Paris ) \n The  UK Space Agency  is a partnership of the UK government departments which are active in space. Through the UK Space Agency, the partners provide delegates to represent the UK on the various ESA governing bodies. Each partner funds its own programme. \n The  Italian Space Agency  ( Agenzia Spaziale Italiana  or ASI) was founded in 1988 to promote, coordinate and conduct space activities in Italy. Operating under the Ministry of the Universities and of Scientific and Technological Research, the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the Council of Ministers. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy's delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies. \n The  German Aerospace Center  (DLR) (German:  Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V. ) is the national research centre for aviation and space flight of the Federal Republic of Germany and of other member states in the  Helmholtz Association . Its extensive research and development projects are included in national and international cooperative programmes. In addition to its research projects, the centre is the assigned space agency of Germany bestowing headquarters of German space flight activities and its associates. \n The  Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial  (INTA) (National Institute for Aerospace Technique) is a Public Research Organization specialized in aerospace research and technology development in  Spain . Between other functions, it serves as a platform for space research and acts as a significant testing facility for the aeronautic and space sector in the country. \n \n  NASA   [  edit  ]   \n ESA has a long history of collaboration with  NASA . Since ESA's astronaut corps was formed, the  Space Shuttle  has been the primary launch vehicle used by ESA's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, the  Spacelab  programme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights on which ESA participate with astronauts in experiments. \n In robotic science mission and exploration missions, NASA has been ESA's main partner.  Cassini\u2013Huygens  was a joint NASA-ESA mission, the  Infrared Space Observatory ,  INTEGRAL ,  SOHO , and others. Also, the  Hubble space telescope  is a joint project of NASA and ESA. Future unmanned projects that are in development right now and are ESA-NASA joint projects include the  James Webb Space Telescope  or the  Laser Interferometer Space Antenna . NASA has committed to provide support to ESA's proposed  MarcoPolo-R  mission to return an asteroid sample to Earth for further analysis. NASA and ESA will also likely join together for a  Mars Sample Return Mission . \n  Cooperation with other space agencies   [  edit  ]   \n Since  China  has started to invest more money into space activities, the  Chinese Space Agency  has sought international partnerships. ESA is, beside the  Russian Space Agency , one of its most important partners. Recently the two space agencies cooperated in the development of the  Double Star Mission .   [ 83 ]    \n ESA entered into a major joint venture with  Russia  in the form of the  CSTS , the preparation of  French Guyana  spaceport for launches of  Soyuz-2  rockets and other projects. With India ESA agreed to send instruments into space aboard the  ISRO 's  Chandrayaan-1  in 2008.   [ 84 ]    ESA is also cooperating with Japan, the most notable current project in collaboration with  JAXA  is the  BepiColombo  mission to  Mercury . \n Speaking to reporters at an air show near Moscow in August 2011, ESA head Jean-Jacques Dordain said ESA and Russia's Roskosmos space agency would \"carry out the first flight to Mars together.\"   [ 85 ]    \n  International Space Station   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  European contribution to the International Space Station  \n \n    \n \n     \n  ISS module Columbus   at Kennedy Space Center \n \n \n With regard to the  International Space Station  (ISS) ESA is not represented by all of its member states:   [ 86 ]    10 of the 20 ESA member states currently participate in the project.   [ note 1 ]    ESA is taking part in the construction and operation of the  ISS  with contributions such as  Columbus , a science laboratory module that was brought into orbit by NASA's  STS-122   Space Shuttle  mission and the  Cupola  observatory module that was completed in July 2005 by  Alenia Spazio  for ESA. The current estimates for the ISS are approaching \u20ac100 billion in total (development, construction and 10 years of maintaining the station) of which ESA has committed to paying \u20ac8 billion.   [ 87 ]    About 90% of the costs of ESA's ISS share will be contributed by Germany (41%), France (28%) and Italy (20%). German ESA astronaut  Thomas Reiter  was the first long-term ISS crew member. \n ESA has developed the  Automated Transfer Vehicle  (ATV) for ISS resupply. Each ATV has a cargo capacity of 7,667 kilograms (16,900\u00a0lb).   [ 88 ]    The first ATV,   Jules Verne  , was launched on 9 March 2008 and on 3 April 2008 successfully docked with the ISS. This manoeuvre, considered a major technical feat, involved using automated systems to allow the ATV to track the ISS, moving at 27,000\u00a0km/h, and attach itself with an accuracy of 2\u00a0cm. \n As of 2013, the spacecraft establishing supply links to the ISS are the Russian  Progress  and  Soyuz , European  ATV , Japanese  Kounotori (HTV) , and the USA  COTS  program vehicles  Dragon  and  Cygnus . \n European Life and Physical Sciences research on board the International Space Station (ISS) is mainly based on the  ELIPS  programme that was initiated in 2001. \n  Miscellaneous   [  edit  ]   \n  Languages   [  edit  ]   \n According to Annex 1, Resolution No. 8 of the  Convention for the establishment of a European Space Agency ,   [ 89 ]     English ,  French  and  German  may be used in all meetings of the Agency, with interpretation provided into these three languages.

It is almost perfectly spherical and consists of hot  plasma  interwoven with  magnetic fields .   [ 12 ]      [ 13 ]    It has a diameter of about 1,392,684\u00a0km (865,374\u00a0mi),   [ 5 ]    around 109 times that of  Earth , and its mass (1.989 \u00d7 10 30  kilograms, approximately 330,000 times the mass of Earth) accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.   [ 14 ]    Chemically, about three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of  hydrogen , while the rest is mostly  helium . The remainder (1.69%, which nonetheless equals 5,600 times the mass of Earth) consists of heavier elements, including  oxygen ,  carbon ,  neon  and  iron , among others.   [ 15 ]      \n The Sun formed about 4.6 billion   [ a ]    years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large  molecular cloud . Most of the matter gathered in the center, while the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that would  become the Solar System . The central mass became increasingly hot and dense, eventually initiating  thermonuclear fusion  in its core. It is thought that almost all stars  form by this process . The Sun is a  G-type main-sequence star  (G2V) based on  spectral class  and it is informally designated as a  yellow dwarf  because its visible radiation is most intense in the yellow-green portion of the  spectrum , and although it is actually white in color, from the surface of the Earth it may appear yellow because of  atmospheric scattering  of blue light.   [ 16 ]    In the spectral class label,  G2  indicates its  surface temperature , of approximately 5778\u00a0K (5505\u00a0\u00b0C), and  V  indicates that the Sun, like most stars, is a  main-sequence  star, and thus generates its energy by  nuclear fusion  of hydrogen  nuclei  into helium. In its core, the Sun fuses 620\u00a0million metric tons of hydrogen each second. \n Once regarded by astronomers as a small and relatively insignificant star, the Sun is now thought to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the  Milky Way , most of which are  red dwarfs .   [ 17 ]      [ 18 ]    The  absolute magnitude  of the Sun is +4.83; however, as the star closest to Earth, the Sun is the brightest object in the sky with an  apparent magnitude  of \u221226.74.   [ 19 ]      [ 20 ]    The Sun's hot  corona  continuously expands in space creating the  solar wind , a stream of charged particles that extends to the  heliopause  at roughly 100  astronomical units . The bubble in the  interstellar medium  formed by the solar wind, the  heliosphere , is the largest continuous structure in the Solar System.   [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]    \n The Sun is currently traveling through the  Local Interstellar Cloud  (near to the  G-cloud ) in the  Local Bubble  zone, within the inner rim of the  Orion Arm  of the Milky Way.   [ 23 ]      [ 24 ]    Of the 50  nearest stellar systems  within 17 light-years from Earth (the closest being a red dwarf named  Proxima Centauri  at approximately 4.2 light-years away), the Sun ranks fourth in mass.   [ 25 ]    The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way at a distance of approximately  24 000  \u2013 26 000    light-years  from the  galactic center , completing  one clockwise orbit , as viewed from the  galactic north pole , in about 225\u2013250\u00a0million years. Since the Milky Way is moving with respect to the  cosmic microwave background radiation  (CMB) in the direction of the constellation  Hydra  with a speed of 550\u00a0km/s, the Sun's resultant velocity with respect to the CMB is about 370\u00a0km/s in the direction of  Crater  or  Leo .   [ 26 ]    \n The mean distance of the Sun from the Earth is approximately 1  astronomical unit  (150,000,000\u00a0km; 93,000,000\u00a0mi), though the distance varies as the Earth moves from  perihelion  in January to  aphelion  in July.   [ 27 ]    At this average distance,  light  travels from the Sun to Earth in about 8 minutes and 19 seconds. The  energy  of this  sunlight  supports almost all life   [ b ]    on Earth by  photosynthesis ,   [ 28 ]    and drives Earth's climate and weather. The enormous effect of the Sun on the Earth has been recognized since  prehistoric times , and the Sun has been  regarded by some cultures  as a  deity . An accurate scientific understanding of the Sun developed slowly, and as recently as the 19th century prominent scientists had little knowledge of the Sun's physical composition and source of energy. This understanding is still developing; there are a number of  present day anomalies  in the Sun's behavior that remain unexplained. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Name and etymology   \n   2   Characteristics  \n \n   2.1   Core   \n   2.2   Radiative zone   \n   2.3   Convective zone   \n   2.4   Photosphere   \n   2.5   Atmosphere   \n   2.6   Magnetic field   \n \n \n   3   Chemical composition  \n \n   3.1   Singly ionized iron group elements   \n   3.2   Solar and planetary mass fractionation relationship   \n \n \n   4   Solar cycles  \n \n   4.1   Sunspots and the sunspot cycle   \n   4.2   Possible long-term cycle   \n \n \n   5   Life phases  \n \n   5.1   Formation   \n   5.2   Main sequence   \n   5.3   After core hydrogen exhaustion   \n   5.4   Earth's fate   \n \n \n   6   Sunlight   \n   7   Motion and location   \n   8   Theoretical problems  \n \n   8.1   Solar neutrino problem   \n   8.2   Coronal heating problem   \n   8.3   Faint young Sun problem   \n \n \n   9   History of observation  \n \n   9.1   Early understanding   \n   9.2   Development of scientific understanding   \n   9.3   Solar space missions   \n \n \n   10   Observation and effects   \n   11   See also   \n   12   Notes   \n   13   References   \n   14   Further reading   \n   15   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Name and etymology  \n The English proper noun  Sun  developed from  Old English   sunne  (in around 725, attested in   Beowulf  ), and may be related to  south . Cognates to English  sun  appear in other  Germanic languages , including  Old Frisian   sunne ,  sonne ,  Old Saxon   sunna ,  Middle Dutch   sonne , modern  Dutch   zon ,  Old High German   sunna , modern  German   Sonne ,  Old Norse   sunna , and  Gothic   sunn\u014d . All Germanic terms for the Sun stem from  Proto-Germanic  * sunn\u014dn .   [ 29 ]      [ 30 ]    \n In relation, the Sun is personified as a goddess in  Germanic paganism ,  S\u00f3l/Sunna .   [ 30 ]    Scholars theorize that the Sun, as a Germanic goddess, may represent an extension of an earlier  Proto-Indo-European  sun deity due to  Indo-European linguistic  connections between Old Norse  S\u00f3l ,  Sanskrit    Surya  ,  Gaulish    Sulis  ,  Lithuanian    Saul\u0117  , and  Slavic   Solntse .   [ 30 ]    \n The English weekday name   Sunday   stems from Old English ( Sunnand\u00e6g ; \"Sun's day\", from before 700) and is ultimately a result of a  Germanic interpretation  of Latin  dies solis , itself a translation of the Greek \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 ( h\u0113m\u00e9ra h\u0113l\u00edou ).   [ 31 ]    The Latin name for the star,  Sol , is widely known but is not common in general English language use; the adjectival form is the related word  solar .   [ 32 ]      [ 33 ]    The term  sol  is also used by planetary astronomers to refer to the duration of a  solar day  on another planet, such as  Mars .   [ 34 ]    A mean  Earth  solar day is approximately 24 hours, while a mean Martian 'sol' is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.   [ 35 ]    \n  Characteristics  \n \n \n    \u00a0   \n \n     \nThis video takes  Solar Dynamics Observatory  images and applies additional processing to enhance the structures visible. The events in this video represent 24 hours of activity on September 25, 2011. \n \n \n The Sun is a  G-type main-sequence star  comprising about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. It is a near-perfect sphere, with an  oblateness  estimated at about 9 millionths,   [ 36 ]    which means that its polar diameter differs from its equatorial diameter by only 10 kilometres (6.2\u00a0mi).   [ 37 ]    Since the Sun consists of a  plasma  and is not solid, it rotates faster at its  equator  than at its  poles . This behavior is known as  differential rotation  and is caused by  convection  in the Sun and the movement of mass, due to steep  temperature gradients  from the core outwards. This mass carries a portion of the Sun\u2019s counter-clockwise  angular momentum  (as viewed from the  ecliptic  north pole), thus redistributing the angular velocity. The period of this  actual rotation  is approximately 25.6 days at the equator and 33.5 days at the poles. However, due to our constantly changing vantage point from the Earth as it orbits the Sun, the  apparent rotation  of the star at its equator is about 28 days.   [ 38 ]    The centrifugal effect of this slow rotation is 18 million times weaker than the surface gravity at the Sun's equator. The tidal effect of the planets is even weaker and does not significantly affect the shape of the Sun.   [ 39 ]    \n The Sun is a  Population I , or heavy-element-rich,   [ c ]    star.   [ 40 ]    The formation of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby  supernovae .   [ 41 ]    This is suggested by a high  abundance  of  heavy elements  in the Solar System, such as  gold  and  uranium , relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called  Population II  (heavy-element-poor) stars. These elements could most plausibly have been produced by  endothermic  nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by  transmutation  through  neutron absorption  within a massive second-generation star.   [ 40 ]    \n The Sun does not have a definite boundary as rocky planets do, and in its outer parts the density of its gases drops exponentially with increasing distance from its center.   [ 42 ]    Nevertheless, it has a well-defined interior structure, described below. The Sun's radius is measured from its center to the edge of the  photosphere . The photosphere is the last visible layer as those above it are too cool or too thin to radiate sufficient light to be visible to the  naked eye    [ 43 ]    in the presence of the brilliant light from the photosphere. During a total  solar eclipse , however, when the photosphere is obscured by the Moon, the Sun's  corona  can be easily seen surrounding it. \n The solar interior is not directly observable, and the Sun itself is opaque to  electromagnetic radiation . However, just as  seismology  uses waves generated by earthquakes to reveal the interior structure of the Earth, the discipline of  helioseismology  makes use of pressure waves ( infrasound ) traversing the Sun's interior to measure and visualize the star's inner structure.   [ 44 ]     Computer modeling  of the Sun is also used as a theoretical tool to investigate its deeper layers. \n  Core  \n Main article:  Solar core  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe structure of the Sun \n \n \n The  core  of the Sun is considered to extend from the center to about 20\u201325% of the solar radius.   [ 45 ]    It has a density of up to  150\u00a0g/cm 3     [ 46 ]      [ 47 ]    (about 150 times the density of water) and a temperature of close to 15.7 million  kelvin  (K).   [ 47 ]    By contrast, the Sun's surface temperature is approximately 5,800\u00a0K. Recent analysis of  SOHO  mission data favors a faster rotation rate in the core than in the rest of the radiative zone.   [ 45 ]    Through most of the Sun's life, energy is produced by  nuclear fusion  through a series of steps called the  p\u2013p (proton\u2013proton) chain ; this process converts  hydrogen  into  helium .   [ 48 ]    Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the  CNO cycle .   [ 49 ]    \n The core is the only region in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely. The rest of the star is heated by energy that is transferred outward by radiation from the core to the convective layers just outside. The energy produced by fusion in the core must then travel through many successive layers to the solar photosphere before it escapes into space as sunlight or the  kinetic energy  of particles.   [ 50 ]      [ 51 ]    \n The  proton\u2013proton chain  occurs around  9.2 \u00d7 10 37   times each second in the core. Since this reaction uses four free  protons  (hydrogen nuclei), it converts about 3.7 \u00d7 10 38  protons to  alpha particles  (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9 \u00d7 10 56  free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2 \u00d7 10 11  kg per second.   [ 51 ]    Since fusing hydrogen into helium releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy,   [ 52 ]    the Sun releases energy at the mass\u2013energy conversion rate of 4.26\u00a0million metric tons per second, 384.6\u00a0 yotta   watts  ( 3.846 \u00d7 10 26 \u00a0W ),   [ 1 ]    or 9.192 \u00d7 10 10 \u00a0 megatons  of  TNT  per second. \n The power production by fusion in the core varies with distance from the solar center. At the center of the Sun, theoretical models estimate it to be approximately 276.5 watts/m 3 ,   [ 53 ]    a power production density that more nearly approximates reptile metabolism than a thermonuclear bomb.   [ d ]    Peak power production in the Sun has been compared to the volumetric heats generated in an active  compost heap . The tremendous power output of the Sun is not due to its high power per volume, but instead due to its large size. \n The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and  expand  slightly against the  weight  of the outer layers, reducing the fusion rate and correcting the  perturbation ; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present level.   [ 54 ]      [ 55 ]    \n The  gamma rays  (high-energy photons) released in fusion reactions are absorbed in only a few millimeters of solar plasma and then re-emitted again in a random direction and at slightly lower energy. Therefore it takes a long time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000\u00a0years.   [ 56 ]    In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the  neutrinos , which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Since energy transport in the Sun is a process which involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly to be changed.   [ 57 ]    \n During the final part of the photon's trip out of the sun, in the convective outer layer, collisions are fewer and far between, and they have less energy. The photosphere is the transparent surface of the Sun where the photons escape as  visible light . Each gamma ray in the Sun's core is converted into several million photons of visible light before escaping into space.  Neutrinos  are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but unlike photons they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were  lower than theories predicted  by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of  neutrino oscillation : the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the  theory , but neutrino detectors were missing   2 \u2044 3   of them because the neutrinos had changed  flavor  by the time they were detected.   [ 58 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nCross-section of a solar-type star ( NASA ) \n \n \n  Radiative zone  \n Main article:  Radiative zone  \n Below about 0.7 solar radii, solar material is hot and dense enough that  thermal radiation  is the primary means of energy transfer from the core.   [ 59 ]    This zone is not regulated by thermal  convection ; however the temperature drops from approximately 7 to 2 million kelvin with increasing distance from the core.   [ 47 ]    This  temperature gradient  is less than the value of the  adiabatic lapse rate  and hence cannot drive convection.   [ 47 ]    Energy is transferred by  radiation \u2014 ions  of  hydrogen  and  helium  emit  photons , which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.   [ 59 ]    The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm 3  to only 0.2 g/cm 3 ) from 0.25 solar radii to the top of the radiative zone.   [ 59 ]    \n The radiative zone and the convective zone are separated by a transition layer, the  tachocline . This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear\u2014a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another.   [ 60 ]    The fluid motions found in the convection zone above, slowly disappear from the top of this layer to its bottom, matching the calm characteristics of the radiative zone on the bottom. Presently, it is hypothesized (see  Solar dynamo ) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's  magnetic field .   [ 47 ]    \n  Convective zone  \n Main article:  Convection zone  \n In the Sun's outer layer, from its surface to approximately 200,000\u00a0km below (70% of the solar radius away from the center), the temperature is lower than in the radiative zone and heavier atoms are not fully ionized. As a result, radiative heat transport is less effective. The density of the gases are low enough to allow convective currents to develop. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, thermal convection develops as  thermal cells  carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere. Once the material cools off at the photosphere, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it picks up more heat from the top of the radiative zone and the cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m 3  (about 1/6,000th the density of air at sea level).   [ 47 ]    \n \n \n    \u00a0   \n \n     \nB\u00e9nard cells. \n \n \n The thermal columns in the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun as the  solar granulation  and  supergranulation . The turbulent convection of this outer part of the solar interior causes \"small-scale\" dynamos that produces magnetic north and south poles all over the surface of the Sun.   [ 47 ]    The Sun's thermal columns are  B\u00e9nard cells  and take the shape of hexagonal prisms.   [ 61 ]    \n  Photosphere  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  effective temperature , or  black body  temperature, of the Sun (5777 K) is the temperature a black body of the same size must have to yield the same total emissive power. \n \n \n Main article:  Photosphere  \n The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the layer below which the Sun becomes  opaque  to visible light.   [ 62 ]    Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, and its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of  H \u2212  ions , which absorb visible light easily.   [ 62 ]    Conversely, the visible light we see is produced as electrons react with  hydrogen  atoms to produce H \u2212  ions.   [ 63 ]      [ 64 ]    The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, being slightly less opaque than  air  on Earth. Because the upper part of the photosphere is cooler than the lower part, an image of the Sun appears brighter in the center than on the edge or  limb  of the solar disk, in a phenomenon known as  limb darkening .   [ 62 ]    The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a  black-body  radiating at about 6,000  K , interspersed with atomic  absorption lines  from the tenuous layers above the photosphere. The photosphere has a particle density of ~10 23 \u00a0m \u22123  (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of the  Earth's atmosphere  at sea level). The photosphere is not fully ionized\u2014the extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.   [ 65 ]    \n During early studies of the  optical spectrum  of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any  chemical elements  then known on Earth. In 1868,  Norman Lockyer  hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element which he dubbed   helium  , after the Greek Sun god  Helios . Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.   [ 66 ]    \n  Atmosphere  \n See also:  Corona \u00a0and  Coronal loop  \n \n    \n \n     \nDuring a total  solar eclipse , the solar  corona  can be seen with the naked eye, during the brief period of totality. \n \n \n The parts of the Sun above the photosphere are referred to collectively as the  solar atmosphere .   [ 62 ]    They can be viewed with telescopes operating across the  electromagnetic spectrum , from radio through visible light to  gamma rays , and comprise five principal zones: the  temperature minimum , the  chromosphere , the  transition region , the  corona , and the  heliosphere .   [ 62 ]    The heliosphere, which may be considered the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun, extends outward past the orbit of  Pluto  to the  heliopause , which forms the boundary with the  interstellar medium . The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.   [ 62 ]    The reason has not been conclusively proven; evidence suggests that  Alfv\u00e9n waves  may have enough energy to heat the corona.   [ 67 ]    \n The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region about  500\u00a0km  above the photosphere, with a temperature of about  4 100 \u00a0 K  .   [ 62 ]    This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as  carbon monoxide  and water, which can be detected via their absorption spectra.   [ 68 ]    \n Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about  2 000 \u00a0km  thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.   [ 62 ]    It is called the  chromosphere  from the Greek root  chroma , meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total  solar eclipses .   [ 59 ]    The temperature in the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around  20 000 \u00a0K  near the top.   [ 62 ]    In the upper part of the chromosphere  helium  becomes partially  ionized .   [ 69 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nTaken by  Hinode 's Solar Optical Telescope on January 12, 2007, this image of the Sun reveals the filamentary nature of the plasma connecting regions of different magnetic polarity. \n \n \n Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200\u00a0km)  transition region , the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000  K  in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000  K .   [ 70 ]    The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.   [ 69 ]    The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude. Rather, it forms a kind of  nimbus  around chromospheric features such as  spicules  and  filaments , and is in constant, chaotic motion.   [ 59 ]    The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from  space  by instruments sensitive to the  extreme ultraviolet  portion of the  spectrum .   [ 71 ]    \n The  corona  is the extended outer atmosphere of the Sun, which is much larger in volume than the Sun itself. The corona continuously expands into space becoming the  solar wind , which fills all the Solar System.   [ 72 ]    The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 10 15 \u201310 16 \u00a0m \u22123 .   [ 69 ]      [ e ]    The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000\u20132,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000\u201320,000,000 K.   [ 70 ]    While no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from  magnetic reconnection .   [ 70 ]      [ 72 ]    \n The  heliosphere , which is the volume around the Sun filled with the solar wind plasma, begins from approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU) and extends to the outer fringes of the Solar System. Its inner boundary is defined as the layer in which the flow of the  solar wind  becomes  superalfv\u00e9nic \u2014that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of  Alfv\u00e9n waves .   [ 73 ]    Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv\u00e9n waves. The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a  spiral  shape,   [ 72 ]    until it impacts the  heliopause  more than 50  AU  from the Sun. In December 2004, the  Voyager 1 probe  passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause. Both of the Voyager probes have recorded higher levels of energetic particles as they approach the boundary.   [ 74 ]    \n  Magnetic field  \n See also:  Stellar magnetic field  \n \n    \n \n     \nIn this false-color ultraviolet image, the Sun shows a C3-class solar flare (white area on upper left), a solar tsunami (wave-like structure, upper right) and multiple filaments of  plasma  following a magnetic field, rising from the stellar surface. \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  heliospheric current sheet  extends to the outer reaches of the Solar System, and results from the influence of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the  plasma  in the  interplanetary medium .   [ 75 ]    \n \n \n The Sun is a magnetically active star. It supports a strong, changing  magnetic field  that varies year-to-year and reverses direction about every eleven years around  solar maximum .   [ 76 ]    The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called  solar activity , including  sunspots  on the surface of the Sun,  solar flares , and variations in  solar wind  that carry material through the Solar System.   [ 77 ]    The effects of solar activity on Earth include  auroras  at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and  electric power . Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the  formation and evolution of the Solar System . Solar activity changes the structure of Earth's  outer atmosphere .   [ 78 ]    \n All matter in the Sun is in the form of  gas  and at high temperatures,  plasma . This makes it possible for the Sun to rotate faster at its equator (about 25 days) than it does at higher latitudes (about 35 days near its poles). The  differential rotation  of the Sun's latitudes causes its  magnetic field  lines to become twisted together over time, producing  magnetic field loops  to erupt from the Sun's surface and trigger the formation of the Sun's dramatic  sunspots  and  solar prominences  (see  magnetic reconnection ). This twisting action creates the  solar dynamo  and an 11-year  solar cycle  of magnetic activity as the Sun's magnetic field reverses itself about every 11 years.   [ 79 ]      [ 80 ]    \n The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself. The magnetized solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space forming what is called the  interplanetary magnetic field .   [ 72 ]    Since the plasma can only move along the magnetic field lines, the interplanetary magnetic field is initially stretched radially away from the Sun. Because the fields above and below the solar equator have different polarities pointing towards and away from the Sun, there exists a thin current layer in the solar equatorial plane, which is called the  heliospheric current sheet .   [ 72 ]    At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the magnetic field and the current sheet into the  Archimedean spiral  like structure called the  Parker spiral .   [ 72 ]    The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field. The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50\u2013400\u00a0 \u03bcT  (at the photosphere) reduces with the cube of the distance to about 0.1\u00a0nT at the distance of the Earth. However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at the Earth's location is around 5\u00a0nT, about a hundred\u00a0times greater.   [ 81 ]    The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun. \n  Chemical composition  \n \n    \n \n     \nImage taken by NASA  STEREO  probes launched in 2006; utilizing two spacecraft to image the Sun at the  extreme UV  wavelength (171  \u00c5 ). \n \n \n \n \u201cFrom a chemist\u2019s point of view, the surface or interior of a star\u2026is boring\u2014there are no molecules there.\u201d\u2014 Roald Hoffmann    [ 82 ]    \n \n See also:  Molecules in stars  \n The Sun is composed primarily of the  chemical elements   hydrogen  and  helium ; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% of the mass of the Sun in the photosphere, respectively.   [ 83 ]    All heavier elements, called   metals   in astronomy, account for less than 2% of the mass. The most abundant metals are oxygen (roughly 1% of the Sun's mass), carbon (0.3%), neon (0.2%), and iron (0.2%).   [ 84 ]    \n The Sun inherited its chemical composition from the  interstellar medium  out of which it formed. The hydrogen and helium in the Sun were produced by  Big Bang nucleosynthesis , and the metals were produced by  stellar nucleosynthesis  in generations of stars that completed their  stellar evolution  and returned their material to the interstellar medium before the formation of the Sun.   [ 85 ]    The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.   [ 86 ]    However, since the Sun formed, some of the helium and heavy elements have gravitationally settled from the photosphere. Therefore, in today's photosphere the helium fraction is reduced and the  metallicity  is only 84% of that in the  protostellar  phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started). The protostellar Sun's composition was reconstructed as 71.1% hydrogen, 27.4% helium, and 1.5% metals.   [ 83 ]    \n In the inner portions of the Sun, nuclear fusion has modified the composition by converting hydrogen into helium, so the innermost portion of the Sun is now roughly 60% helium, with the metal abundance unchanged. Because the interior of the Sun is radiative, not convective (see  Radiative zone  above), none of the fusion products from the core have risen to the photosphere.   [ 87 ]    \n The reactive core zone of \"hydrogen burning\", where hydrogen is converted into helium, is starting to surround the core of \"helium ash\". This development will continue and will eventually cause the Sun to leave the  main sequence , to become a  red giant    [ 88 ]    \n The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using  spectroscopy  of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in  meteorites  that have never been heated to melting temperatures. These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by settling of heavy elements. The two methods generally agree well.   [ 15 ]    \n  Singly ionized iron group elements  \n In the 1970s, much research focused on the abundances of  iron group  elements in the Sun.   [ 89 ]      [ 90 ]    Although significant research was done, the abundance determination of some iron group elements (e.g.  cobalt  and  manganese ) was still difficult at least as far as 1978 because of their hyperfine structures.   [ 89 ]    \n The first largely complete set of  oscillator strengths  of singly ionized iron group elements were made available first in the 1960s,   [ 91 ]    and improved oscillator strengths were computed in 1976.   [ 92 ]    In 1978 the abundances of 'singly Ionized' elements of the iron group were derived.   [ 89 ]    \n  Solar and planetary mass fractionation relationship  \n Various authors have considered the existence of a mass  fractionation  relationship between the isotopic compositions of solar and planetary  noble gases ,   [ 93 ]    for example correlations between isotopic compositions of planetary and solar  neon  and  xenon .   [ 94 ]    Nevertheless, the belief that the whole Sun has the same composition as the solar atmosphere was still widespread, at least until 1983.   [ 95 ]    \n In 1983, it was claimed that it was the fractionation in the Sun itself that caused the fractionation relationship between the isotopic compositions of planetary and solar wind implanted noble gases.   [ 95 ]    \n  Solar cycles  \n Main articles:  Sunspots  and  List of solar cycles  \n  Sunspots and the sunspot cycle  \n \n    \n \n     \nMeasurements of solar cycle variation during the last 30 years \n \n \n When observing the Sun with appropriate filtration, the most immediately visible features are usually its  sunspots , which are well-defined surface areas that appear darker than their surroundings because of lower temperatures. Sunspots are regions of intense magnetic activity where  convection  is inhibited by strong magnetic fields, reducing energy transport from the hot interior to the surface. The magnetic field causes strong heating in the corona, forming  active regions  that are the source of intense  solar flares  and  coronal mass ejections . The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.   [ 96 ]    \n The number of sunspots visible on the Sun is not constant, but varies over an 11-year cycle known as the  solar cycle . At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none at all can be seen. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the sunspot cycle progresses, the number of sunspots increases and they move closer to the equator of the Sun, a phenomenon described by  Sp\u00f6rer's law . Sunspots usually exist as pairs with opposite magnetic polarity. The magnetic polarity of the leading sunspot alternates every solar cycle, so that it will be a north magnetic pole in one solar cycle and a south magnetic pole in the next.   [ 97 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nHistory of the number of observed sunspots during the last 250 years, which shows the ~11-year solar cycle \n \n \n The solar cycle has a great influence on  space weather , and a significant influence on the Earth's climate since the Sun's luminosity has a direct relationship with magnetic activity.   [ 98 ]    Solar activity minima tend to be correlated with colder temperatures, and longer than average solar cycles tend to be correlated with hotter temperatures. In the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during this period. During this era, known as the  Maunder minimum  or  Little Ice Age , Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.   [ 99 ]    Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of  tree rings  and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.   [ 100 ]    \n  Possible long-term cycle  \n A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years. These could provide a better explanation of the  ice ages  than the  Milankovitch cycles .   [ 101 ]      [ 102 ]    \n  Life phases  \n Main articles:  Formation and evolution of the Solar System  and  Stellar evolution  \n The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life. It has not changed dramatically for four billion   [ a ]    years, and will remain fairly stable for four billion more. However after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes, both internally and externally. \n  Formation  \n The Sun was formed about 4.57 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant  molecular cloud  that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and which probably gave birth to many other stars.   [ 103 ]    This age is estimated using  computer models  of  stellar evolution  and through  nucleocosmochronology .   [ 9 ]    The result is consistent with the  radiometric date  of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.   [ 104 ]      [ 105 ]    Studies of ancient  meteorites  reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as  iron-60 , that form only in exploding, short-lived stars. This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed. A  shock wave  from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the gases within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.   [ 106 ]    As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to  conservation of angular momentum  and heat up with the increasing pressure. Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, while the rest flattened out into a disk which would become the planets and other solar system bodies. Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accreted more gas from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering  nuclear fusion . Thus, the Sun was born. \n  Main sequence  \n \n    \n \n     \nEvolution of the Sun's  luminosity ,  radius  and  effective temperature  compared to the present Sun. After Ribas (2010)   [ 107 ]    \n \n \n The Sun is about halfway through its  main-sequence  stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million  tonnes  of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing  neutrinos  and  solar radiation . At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 Earth-masses of matter into energy. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10  billion  years as a main-sequence star.   [ 108 ]    \n  After core hydrogen exhaustion  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe size of the current Sun (now in the  main sequence ) compared to its estimated size during its red giant phase in the future \n \n \n The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a  supernova . Instead it will exit the  main sequence  in approximately 5.4 billion years and start to turn into a  red giant . It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of the  solar system 's  inner planets , possibly including Earth.   [ 109 ]      [ 110 ]    \n Even before it becomes a red giant, the luminosity of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and the Earth will be hotter than Venus is today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a  subgiant  phase and slowly double in size over about half a billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over about half a billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today and a couple of thousand times more luminous. This then starts the  red giant branch  (RGB) phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.   [ 110 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nEvolution of a sun-like star. The track of a one solar mass star on the  Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram  is shown from the main sequence to the post-AGB stage. \n \n \n After RGB the Sun now has only about 120 million years of active life left, but they are highly eventful. First the core ignites violently in the  helium flash , and the Sun shrinks back to around 10 times its current size with 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It has now reached the  red clump  or  horizontal branch  (HB), but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the HB. Instead it just becomes mildly larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core.   [ 110 ]    \n When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous. This is the  asymptotic giant branch  (AGB) phase, and the Sun is alternately burning hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell. After about 20 million years on the early AGB, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and  thermal pulses  that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so. The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU.   [ 111 ]    Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss. Models that have higher mass loss on the RGB produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the AGB, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.   [ 110 ]    For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula. By the end of that phase - lasting approximately 500,000 years - the Sun will only have about half of its current mass. \n The post AGB evolution is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant while the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionised into a  planetary nebula  as the exposed core reaches 30,000K. The final naked core temperature will be over 100,000K, after which the remnant will cool towards a  white dwarf . The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to black.   [ 112 ]      [ 113 ]    \n  Earth's fate  \n Main article:  Future of the Earth  \n \n    \n \n     \nAn artist's depiction of the Sun entering its red giant phase viewed from Earth. All life on Earth is extinct at this phase. \n \n \n In the long run, the Earth's water and most of its atmosphere will eventually escape into space. During its life in the  main sequence , the Sun is becoming more luminous (about 10% every 1 billion years) and its surface temperature is slowly rising. The Sun used to be fainter in its early past. The increase in solar temperatures is such that in about another billion years the Earth's atmosphere will no longer be cold enough to freeze water vapour at high altitudes. [   citation needed   ]  Water molecules will then be able to reach the top of the atmosphere, which will lead to the Earth's water escaping into space, rendering the planet inhospitable to all known terrestrial life.   [ 114 ]      [ 115 ]    The Earth is not expected to survive the Sun's transition into a red giant. At its largest, the Sun will have a maximum radius beyond the Earth's current orbit, 1  AU  (1.5 \u00d7 10 11   m ), 250 times the present radius of the Sun.   [ 114 ]    By the time the Sun has entered the asymptotic red giant branch, the orbits of the planets will have drifted outwards due to a loss of roughly 30% of the Sun's present mass. Most of this mass will be lost as the solar wind increases. Also,  tidal acceleration  will help boost the Earth to a higher orbit (similar to what the Earth does to the moon). If it were only for this, Earth would probably remain outside the Sun. However, current research suggests that after the Sun becomes a red giant, Earth will be pulled in owing to  tidal deceleration .   [ 114 ]    \n  Sunlight  \n Main article:  Sunlight  \n \n    \n \n     \nComparison of the Sun's apparent size, as seen from the vicinity of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto \n \n \n Sunlight is Earth's primary source of energy. The only other source of energy the Earth has are the fissionable materials generated by the cataclysmic death of another star. These fissionable materials trapped in the Earth's crust is what gives rise to  geothermal energy , which drives the volcanism on Earth while also making it possible for mankind to fuel  nuclear reactors . The  solar constant  is the amount of power that the Sun deposits per unit area that is directly exposed to sunlight. The solar constant is equal to approximately  1 368 \u00a0W/m 2   ( watts  per square meter) at a distance of one  astronomical unit  (AU) from the Sun (that is, on or near Earth).   [ 116 ]    Sunlight at the top of Earth's atmosphere is composed (by total energy) of about 50% infrared light, 40% visible light, and 10% ultraviolet light.   [ 117 ]    \n Sunlight on the surface of Earth is  attenuated  by the Earth's atmosphere so that less power arrives at the surface\u2014closer to  1 000 \u00a0W/m 2   in clear conditions when the Sun is near the  zenith .   [ 118 ]    The atmosphere in particular filters out over 70% of solar  ultraviolet , especially at the shorter wavelengths.   [ 119 ]    \n Solar energy can be harnessed by a variety of natural and synthetic processes\u2014 photosynthesis  by plants captures the energy of sunlight and converts it to chemical form (oxygen and reduced carbon compounds), while direct heating or electrical conversion by  solar cells  are used by  solar power  equipment to generate electricity or to do other useful work, sometimes employing  concentrating solar power  (that it is measured in suns). The energy stored in  petroleum  and other fossil fuels was originally converted from sunlight by  photosynthesis  in the distant past.   [ 120 ]    \n  Motion and location  \n \n    \n \n     \nMotion of the  barycenter  of the Solar System relative to the Sun \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nIllustration of the Milky Way galaxy, showing the location of the Sun (click to enlarge) \n \n \n See also:  Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)  \n The Sun lies close to the inner rim of the  Milky Way Galaxy 's  Orion Arm , in the  Local Fluff  or the  Gould Belt , at a hypothesized distance of 7.5\u20138.5  kpc  (25,000\u201328,000 light-years) from the  Galactic Center ,   [ 121 ]      [ 122 ]      [ 123 ]      [ 124 ]    contained within the Local Bubble, a space of rarefied hot gas, possibly produced by the supernova remnant,  Geminga .   [ 125 ]    The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the  Perseus Arm , is about 6,500 light-years.   [ 126 ]    The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is found in what scientists call the  galactic habitable zone . \n The  Apex of the Sun's Way , or the  solar apex , is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way, relative to other nearby stars. The general direction of the Sun's galactic motion is towards the star  Vega  in the constellation of  Lyra  at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the  Galactic Center . \n The Sun's orbit around the Galaxy is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the galactic spiral arms and non-uniform mass distributions. In addition the Sun oscillates up and down relative to the galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit. It has been argued that the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with  mass extinctions  on Earth, perhaps due to increased  impact events .   [ 127 ]    It takes the Solar System about 225\u2013250 million years to complete one orbit of the galaxy (a   galactic year  ),   [ 128 ]    so it is thought to have completed 20\u201325 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun. The  orbital speed  of the Solar System about the center of the Galaxy is approximately 251\u00a0km/s (156\u00a0mi/s).   [ 129 ]    At this speed, it takes around 1,190 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 7 days to travel 1  AU .   [ 130 ]    \n The Sun's motion about the center of mass of the Solar System is complicated by perturbations from the planets. The barycenter is just outside the volume of the Sun when Jupiter and Saturn (the two planets with the greatest masses) are roughly in the same direction, as seen from the Sun. When they are in opposite directions, and the other planets are aligned appropriately, the barycentre can be very close to the centre of the Sun. Every few hundred years this motion switches between  prograde and retrograde .   [ 131 ]    \n  Theoretical problems  \n \n    \n \n     \nMap of the full sun by  STEREO  and  SDO  spacecraft \n \n \n  Solar neutrino problem  \n Main article:  Solar neutrino problem  \n For many years the number of solar  electron neutrinos  detected on Earth was one third to one half of the number predicted by the  standard solar model . This anomalous result was termed the  solar neutrino problem . Theories proposed to resolve the problem either tried to reduce the temperature of the Sun's interior to explain the lower neutrino flux, or posited that electron neutrinos could  oscillate \u2014that is, change into the then-undetectable  tau  and  muon neutrinos  as they traveled between the Sun and the Earth.   [ 132 ]    Several neutrino observatories were built in the 1980s to measure the solar neutrino flux as accurately as possible, including the  Sudbury Neutrino Observatory  in Canada and the  Kamiokande  laboratory in Japan.   [ 133 ]    Results from these observatories eventually led to the discovery that neutrinos have a very small  rest mass  and do indeed oscillate.   [ 134 ]      [ 58 ]    Moreover, in 2001 the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory was able to detect all three types of neutrinos directly, and found that the Sun's  total  neutrino emission rate agreed with the Standard Solar Model, although depending on the neutrino energy as few as one-third of the neutrinos seen at Earth are of the electron type.   [ 133 ]      [ 135 ]    This proportion agrees with that predicted by the  Mikheyev\u2013Smirnov\u2013Wolfenstein effect  (also known as the matter effect), which describes neutrino oscillation in matter, and it is now considered a solved problem.   [ 133 ]    \n  Coronal heating problem  \n Main article:  Corona  \n The optical surface of the Sun (the  photosphere ) is known to have a temperature of approximately 6,000  K . Above it lies the solar corona, rising to a temperature of 1,000,000\u20132,000,000\u00a0K.   [ 70 ]    The high temperature of the corona shows that it is heated by something other than direct heat  conduction  from the photosphere.   [ 72 ]    \n It is thought that the energy necessary to heat the corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating.   [ 70 ]    The first is  wave  heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.   [ 70 ]    These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient gas in the form of heat.   [ 136 ]    The other is  magnetic  heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through  magnetic reconnection  in the form of large  solar flares  and myriad similar but smaller events\u2014 nanoflares .   [ 137 ]    \n Currently, it is unclear whether waves are an efficient heating mechanism. All waves except  Alfv\u00e9n waves  have been found to dissipate or refract before reaching the corona.   [ 138 ]    In addition, Alfv\u00e9n waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.   [ 70 ]    \n  Faint young Sun problem  \n Main article:  Faint young Sun paradox  \n Theoretical models of the Sun's development suggest that 3.8 to 2.5 billion years ago, during the  Archean period , the Sun was only about 75% as bright as it is today. Such a weak star would not have been able to sustain liquid water on the Earth's surface, and thus life should not have been able to develop. However, the geological record demonstrates that the Earth has remained at a fairly constant temperature throughout its history, and that the young Earth was somewhat warmer than it is today. The consensus among scientists is that the young Earth's atmosphere contained much larger quantities of  greenhouse gases  (such as  carbon dioxide ,  methane  and/or  ammonia ) than are present today, which trapped enough heat to compensate for the smaller amount of  solar energy  reaching the planet.   [ 139 ]    \n  History of observation  \n  Early understanding  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe  Trundholm Sun chariot  pulled by a horse is a sculpture believed to be illustrating an important part of  Nordic Bronze Age  mythology. The sculpture is probably from around 1350  BC . It is displayed at the  National Museum of Denmark . \n \n \n See also:  The Sun in culture  \n Like other natural phenomena, the Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures throughout human history. Humanity's most fundamental understanding of the Sun is as the luminous disk in the  sky , whose presence above the  horizon  creates day and whose absence causes night. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the Sun was thought to be a  solar deity  or other  supernatural  phenomenon.  Worship  of the Sun was central to civilizations such as the  ancient Egyptians , the  Inca  of  South America  and the  Aztecs  of what is now  Mexico . In religions such as  Hinduism , the Sun is still considered a God. Many ancient monuments were constructed with solar phenomena in mind; for example, stone  megaliths  accurately mark the summer or winter  solstice  (some of the most prominent megaliths are located in  Nabta Playa ,  Egypt ;  Mnajdra , Malta and at  Stonehenge , England);  Newgrange , a prehistoric human-built mount in  Ireland , was designed to detect the winter solstice; the pyramid of  El Castillo  at  Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1  in Mexico is designed to cast shadows in the shape of serpents climbing the  pyramid  at the vernal and autumn  equinoxes . \n The Egyptians portrayed  Ra  (=the sun) as being carried across the sky in a solar barque, accompanied by lesser gods, and to the Greeks, he was  Helios , carried by a chariot drawn by fiery horses. From the reign of  Elagabalus  in the  late Roman Empire  the Sun's birthday was a holiday celebrated as  Sol Invictus  (literally \u201cunconquered sun\u201d) soon after the winter solstice which may have been an antecedent to  Christmas . Regarding the  fixed stars , the Sun appears from Earth to revolve once a year along the  ecliptic  through the  zodiac , and so Greek astronomers considered it to be one of the seven  planets  (Greek  planetes , \u201cwanderer\u201d), after which the seven days of the  week  are named in some languages.   [ 140 ]      [ 141 ]      [ 142 ]    \n   \n  Development of scientific understanding  \n \n \n    \u00a0   \n \n     \nSince the discovery of sunspots by Galileo in 1609, scientists have continued to study the Sun. \n \n \n In the early first millennium BC,  Babylonian astronomers  observed that the Sun's motion along the ecliptic was not uniform, though they were unaware of why this was; it is today known that this is due to the movement of the  Earth  in an  elliptic orbit  around the Sun, with the Earth moving faster when it is nearer to the Sun at  perihelion  and moving slower when it is farther away at  aphelion .   [ 143 ]    \n One of the first people to offer a scientific or philosophical explanation for the Sun was the  Greek   philosopher   Anaxagoras , who reasoned that it was a giant flaming ball of metal even larger than the  Peloponnesus  rather than the  chariot  of  Helios , and that the  Moon  reflected the light of the Sun.   [ 144 ]    For teaching this  heresy , he was imprisoned by the authorities and  sentenced to death , though he was later released through the intervention of  Pericles .  Eratosthenes  estimated the distance between the Earth and the Sun in the 3rd century BC as \"of stadia  myriads  400 and 80000\", the translation of which is ambiguous, implying either 4,080,000  stadia  (755,000\u00a0km) or 804,000,000 stadia (148 to 153 million kilometers or 0.99 to 1.02 AU); the latter value is correct to within a few percent. In the 1st century AD,  Ptolemy  estimated the distance as 1,210 times the  Earth radius , approximately 7.71\u00a0million kilometers (0.0515\u00a0AU).   [ 145 ]    \n The theory that the Sun is the center around which the planets move was first proposed by the ancient Greek  Aristarchus of Samos  in the 3rd century BC, and later adopted by  Seleucus of Seleucia  (see  Heliocentrism ). This largely philosophical view was developed into fully predictive  mathematical model  of a heliocentric system in the 16th century by  Nicolaus Copernicus . In the early 17th century, the invention of the  telescope  permitted detailed observations of  sunspots  by  Thomas Harriot ,  Galileo Galilei  and other astronomers. Galileo made some of the first known telescopic observations of sunspots and posited that they were on the surface of the Sun rather than small objects passing between the Earth and the Sun.   [ 146 ]    Sunspots were also observed since the  Han Dynasty  (206 BC\u00a0\u2013 AD 220) by  Chinese astronomers  who maintained records of these observations for centuries.  Averroes  also provided a description of sunspots in the 12th century.   [ 147 ]    \n  Arabic astronomical contributions  include  Albatenius  discovery that the direction of the Sun's  apogee  (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing.   [ 148 ]    (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the  Earth's  orbit).  Ibn Yunus  observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large  astrolabe .   [ 149 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nSol, the Sun, from a 1550 edition of  Guido Bonatti 's  Liber astronomiae . \n \n \n The  transit of Venus  was first observed in 1032 by Persian astronomer and polymath  Avicenna , who concluded that Venus is closer to the Earth than the Sun,   [ 150 ]    while one of the first observations of the  transit of Mercury  was conducted by  Ibn Bajjah  in the 12th century.   [ 151 ]    [   verification needed   ]  \n In 1672  Giovanni Cassini  and  Jean Richer  determined the distance to  Mars  and were thereby able to calculate the distance to the Sun.  Isaac Newton  observed the Sun's light using a  prism , and showed that it was made up of light of many colors,   [ 152 ]    while in 1800  William Herschel  discovered  infrared  radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum.   [ 153 ]    The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun;  Joseph von Fraunhofer  recorded more than 600  absorption lines  in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as  Fraunhofer lines . \n In the early years of the modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle.  Lord Kelvin  suggested that the Sun was a gradually cooling liquid body that was radiating an internal store of heat.   [ 154 ]    Kelvin and  Hermann von Helmholtz  then proposed a  gravitational contraction  mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time.   [ 154 ]    In 1890  Joseph Lockyer , who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.   [ 155 ]    \n Not until 1904 was a documented solution offered.  Ernest Rutherford  suggested that the Sun's output could be maintained by an internal source of heat, and suggested  radioactive decay  as the source.   [ 156 ]    However, it would be  Albert Einstein  who would provide the essential clue to the source of the Sun's energy output with his  mass-energy equivalence  relation   E  =  mc  2  .   [ 157 ]    \n In 1920, Sir  Arthur Eddington  proposed that the pressures and temperatures at the core of the Sun could produce a nuclear fusion reaction that merged hydrogen (protons) into helium nuclei, resulting in a production of energy from the net change in mass.   [ 158 ]    The preponderance of hydrogen in the Sun was confirmed in 1925 by  Cecilia Payne  using the  ionization  theory developed by  Meghnad Saha , an Indian physicist. The theoretical concept of fusion was developed in the 1930s by the astrophysicists  Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar  and  Hans Bethe . Hans Bethe calculated the details of the two main energy-producing nuclear reactions that power the Sun.   [ 159 ]      [ 160 ]    \n Finally, a seminal paper entitled \" Synthesis of the Elements in Stars \" was published in 1957 by  Margaret Burbidge ,  Geoffrey Burbidge ,  William Fowler  and  Fred Hoyle .   [ 161 ]    The paper demonstrated convincingly that most of the elements in the universe had been  synthesized  by nuclear reactions inside stars, some like the Sun. \n  Solar space missions  \n See also:  Solar observatory  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe Sun giving out a large geomagnetic storm on 1:29 pm, EST, 13 th  March 2012 \n \n \n \n \n    \u00a0   \n \n     \nA lunar transit of the Sun captured during calibration of  STEREO  B's ultraviolet imaging cameras   [ 162 ]    \n \n \n The first satellites designed to observe the Sun were  NASA 's  Pioneers  5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which were launched between 1959 and 1968. These probes orbited the Sun at a distance similar to that of the  Earth , and made the first detailed measurements of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. Pioneer 9 operated for a particularly long time, transmitting data until May 1983.   [ 163 ]      [ 164 ]    \n In the 1970s, two  Helios  spacecraft and the  Skylab   Apollo Telescope Mount  provided scientists with significant new data on solar wind and the solar corona. The Helios 1 and 2 probes were U.S.\u2013German collaborations that studied the solar wind from an orbit carrying the spacecraft inside  Mercury 's orbit at  perihelion .   [ 165 ]    The Skylab space station, launched by NASA in 1973, included a solar  observatory  module called the Apollo Telescope Mount that was operated by astronauts resident on the station.   [ 71 ]    Skylab made the first time-resolved observations of the solar transition region and of ultraviolet emissions from the solar corona.   [ 71 ]    Discoveries included the first observations of  coronal mass ejections , then called \"coronal transients\", and of  coronal holes , now known to be intimately associated with the  solar wind .   [ 165 ]    \n In 1980, the  Solar Maximum Mission  was launched by  NASA . This spacecraft was designed to observe  gamma rays ,  X-rays  and  UV  radiation from  solar flares  during a time of high solar activity and  solar luminosity . Just a few months after launch, however, an electronics failure caused the probe to go into standby mode, and it spent the next three years in this inactive state. In 1984  Space Shuttle Challenger  mission STS-41C retrieved the satellite and repaired its electronics before re-releasing it into orbit. The Solar Maximum Mission subsequently acquired thousands of images of the solar corona before  re-entering  the Earth's atmosphere in June 1989.   [ 166 ]    \n Launched in 1991, Japan's  Yohkoh  ( Sunbeam ) satellite observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed scientists to identify several different types of flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an  annular eclipse  in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.   [ 167 ]    \n One of the most important solar missions to date has been the  Solar and Heliospheric Observatory , jointly built by the  European Space Agency  and  NASA  and launched on 2 December 1995.   [ 71 ]    Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009.   [ 168 ]    It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the  Solar Dynamics Observatory  (SDO), was launched in February 2010.   [ 169 ]    Situated at the  Lagrangian point  between the Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch.   [ 71 ]    Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of  comets , mostly tiny  sungrazing comets  which incinerate as they pass the Sun.   [ 170 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nA solar prominence erupts in August 2012, as captured by SDO \n \n \n All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The  Ulysses probe  was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to  Jupiter , to \"slingshot\" past the planet into an orbit which would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Serendipitously, it was well-placed to observe the collision of  Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9  with Jupiter in 1994. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750\u00a0km/s which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes which scattered galactic  cosmic rays .   [ 171 ]    \n Elemental abundances in the photosphere are well known from  spectroscopic  studies, but the composition of the interior of the Sun is more poorly understood. A  solar wind  sample return mission,  Genesis , was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material. Genesis returned to Earth in 2004 but was damaged by a crash landing after its  parachute  failed to deploy on re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Despite severe damage, some usable samples have been recovered from the spacecraft's sample return module and are undergoing analysis.   [ 172 ]    \n The Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) mission was launched in October 2006. Two identical spacecraft were launched into orbits that cause them to (respectively) pull further ahead of and fall gradually behind the Earth. This enables  stereoscopic  imaging of the Sun and solar phenomena, such as  coronal mass ejections .   [ 173 ]      [ 174 ]    \n The  Indian Space Research Organisation  has scheduled the launch of a 100\u00a0kg satellite named  Aditya  for 2015\u201316.

[ 3 ]      [ 4 ]    Besides the Sun, other well-known examples of G-type main-sequence stars include  Alpha Centauri A ,  Tau Ceti , and  51 Pegasi .   [ 5 ]      [ 6 ]      [ 7 ]    \n The term  yellow dwarf  is a misnomer, as G stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only slightly yellow for the less luminous GV stars.   [ 8 ]    The Sun is in fact white, but appears yellow through the  Earth 's atmosphere due to  Rayleigh scattering . In addition, although the term \"dwarf\" is used to contrast yellow main-sequence stars from  giant stars , yellow dwarfs like the Sun outshine 90% of the stars in the Galaxy (which are largely  orange dwarfs ,  red dwarfs , and  white dwarfs , the latter being a post-main-sequence star). \n A G-type main-sequence star will fuse hydrogen for approximately 10 billion years, until it is exhausted at the center of the star. When this happens, the star expands to many times its previous size and becomes a  red giant , such as  Aldebaran  (Alpha Tauri).   [ 9 ]    Eventually the red giant sheds its outer layers of gas, which become a  planetary nebula , while the core cools and contracts into a compact, dense white dwarf.   [ 2 ]    \n  Spectral Standard Stars   [  edit  ]   \n The revised Yerkes Atlas system (Johnson &amp; Morgan 1953)   [ 10 ]    listed 11 G-type  dwarf  spectral standard stars; however, not all of these have survived to this day as standards. The \"anchor points\" of the  MK spectral classification  system among the G-type  main-sequence  dwarf stars, i.e. those standard stars that have remained unchanged over years, are  beta CVn  (G0 V), the  Sun  (G2 V),  Kappa1 Ceti  (G5 V),  61 Ursae Majoris  (G8 V).   [ 11 ]    Other primary MK standard stars include HD 115043 (G1 V) and  16 Cygni  B (G3 V).   [ 12 ]    The choices of G4 and G6 dwarf standards have changed slightly over the years among expert classifiers, but often-used examples include  70 Virginis  (G4 V) and  82 Eridani  (G6 V). There are not yet any generally agreed upon G7 V and G9 V standards. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Brown dwarf  \n  K V star  \n  Red dwarf  \n  Solar twin  \n  Star count , survey of stars \n  Stellar classification , Class G \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^      Empirical bolometric corrections for the main-sequence , G.

astronomers  to describe the mass of a  star . It is usually enumerated in terms of the Sun's mass as a proportion of a  solar mass . Hence, the bright star  Sirius  has around 2.02\u00a0solar masses.   [ 1 ]    A star's mass will vary over its lifetime as additional mass becomes accreted, such as from a companion star, or mass is ejected with the  stellar wind  or pulsational behavior. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Properties   \n   2   Range   \n   3   Change   \n   4   References   \n \n \n  \n  Properties   [  edit  ]   \n Stars are sometimes grouped by mass based upon their evolutionary behavior as they approach the end of their nuclear fusion lifetimes.  Very low mass stars  with masses below 0.5 solar masses do not enter the  asymptotic giant branch  (AGB) but evolve directly into white dwarfs.  Low mass stars  with a mass below about 1.8\u20132.2 solar masses (depending on composition) do enter the AGB, where they develop a degenerate helium core.  Intermediate-mass stars  undergo  helium fusion  and develop a degenerate carbon-oxygen core.  Massive stars  have a minimum mass of 7\u201310 solar masses, but this may be as low as 5\u20136 solar masses. These stars undergo  carbon fusion , with their lives ending in a core-collapse  supernova  explosion.   [ 2 ]     Black holes  created as a result of a stellar collapse are termed  stellar mass black holes . \n The combination of the radius and the mass of a star determines the surface gravity. Giant stars have a much lower surface gravity than main sequence stars, while the opposite is the case for degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the  absorption lines .   [ 3 ]    \n  Range   [  edit  ]   \n One of the most massive stars known is  Eta Carinae ,   [ 4 ]    with 100\u2013150\u00a0times as much mass as the Sun; its lifespan is very short\u2014only several million years at most. A study of the  Arches cluster  suggests that 150\u00a0solar masses is the upper limit for stars in the current era of the universe.   [ 5 ]    The reason for this limit is not precisely known, but it is partially due to the  Eddington luminosity  which defines the maximum amount of luminosity that can pass through the atmosphere of a star without ejecting the gases into space. However, a star named  R136a1  in the RMC 136a star cluster has been measured at 265 solar masses, putting this limit into question.   [ 6 ]    A study have determined that stars larger than 150 solar masses in  R136  were created through the collision and merger of massive stars in close  binary systems , providing a way to sidestep the 150 solar mass limit.   [ 7 ]    \n The first stars to form after the Big Bang may have been larger, up to 300 solar masses or more,   [ 8 ]    due to the complete absence of elements heavier than  lithium  in their composition. This generation of supermassive,  population III stars  is long extinct, however, and currently only theoretical. \n With a mass only 93\u00a0times that of  Jupiter ,  AB Doradus C , a companion to AB Doradus A, is the smallest known star undergoing nuclear fusion in its core.   [ 9 ]    For stars with similar metallicity to the Sun, the theoretical minimum mass the star can have, and still undergo fusion at the core, is estimated to be about 75 times the mass of Jupiter.   [ 10 ]      [ 11 ]    When the metallicity is very low, however, a recent study of the faintest stars found that the minimum star size seems to be about 8.3% of the solar mass, or about 87 times the mass of Jupiter.   [ 11 ]      [ 12 ]    Smaller bodies are called  brown dwarfs , which occupy a poorly defined grey area between stars and  gas giants . \n  Change   [  edit  ]   \n In the present day, the Sun is losing mass from the emission of electromagnetic energy and by the ejection of matter with the  solar wind . It is expelling about (2\u20133) \u00d7 10 \u221214   solar masses  (M \u2609 ) per year.   [ 13 ]    The mass loss rate will increase when the Sun enters the  red giant  stage, climbing to (7\u20139) \u00d7 10 \u221214  M \u2609  y \u22121  when it reaches the  tip of the red giant branch . This will rise to 10 \u22126  M \u2609  y \u22121  on the  asymptotic giant branch , before peaking at a rate of 10 \u22125  to 10 \u22124  M \u2609  y \u22121  as the Sun generates a  planetary nebula . By the time the Sun becomes a degenerate  white dwarf , it will have lost 46% of its starting mass.   [ 14 ]    \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^      Liebert, J. et al.

It comprises the major component of the  Sun . Heating a gas may  ionize  its molecules or atoms (reducing or increasing the number of  electrons  in them), thus turning it into a plasma, which contains  charged  particles: positive  ions  and negative electrons or ions.   [ 2 ]    Ionization can be induced by other means, such as strong electromagnetic field applied with a  laser  or  microwave  generator, and is accompanied by the dissociation of  molecular bonds , if present.   [ 3 ]    Plasma can also be created by the application of an electric field on a gas, where the underlying process is the  Townsend avalanche . \n The presence of a non-negligible number of  charge carriers  makes the plasma  electrically conductive  so that it responds strongly to  electromagnetic fields . Plasma, therefore, has properties quite unlike those of  solids ,  liquids , or  gases  and is considered a distinct  state of matter . Like gas, plasma does not have a definite shape or a definite volume unless enclosed in a container; unlike gas, under the influence of a magnetic field, it may form structures such as filaments, beams and  double layers . Some common plasmas are found in  stars  and  neon signs . In the  universe , plasma is the most common  state of matter  for  ordinary matter , most of which is in the rarefied  intergalactic plasma  (particularly  intracluster medium ) and in stars. Much of the understanding of plasmas has come from the pursuit of controlled  nuclear fusion  and  fusion power , for which plasma physics provides the scientific basis. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Properties and parameters  \n \n   1.1   Definition   \n   1.2   Ranges of parameters   \n   1.3   Degree of ionization   \n   1.4   Temperatures  \n \n   1.4.1   Thermal vs. non-thermal plasmas   \n \n \n   1.5   Potentials   \n   1.6   Magnetization   \n   1.7   Comparison of plasma and gas phases   \n \n \n   2   Common plasmas   \n   3   Complex plasma phenomena  \n \n   3.1   Filamentation   \n   3.2   Shocks or double layers   \n   3.3   Electric fields and circuits   \n   3.4   Cellular structure   \n   3.5   Critical ionization velocity   \n   3.6   Ultracold plasma   \n   3.7   Non-neutral plasma   \n   3.8   Dusty plasma and grain plasma   \n   3.9   Impermeable plasma   \n \n \n   4   Mathematical descriptions  \n \n   4.1   Fluid model   \n   4.2   Kinetic model   \n \n \n   5   Artificial plasmas  \n \n   5.1   Generation of artificial plasma  \n \n   5.1.1   Electric arc   \n \n \n   5.2   Examples of industrial/commercial plasma  \n \n   5.2.1   Low-pressure discharges   \n   5.2.2   Atmospheric pressure   \n \n \n \n \n   6   History   \n   7   Fields of active research   \n   8   See also   \n   9   Notes   \n   10   References   \n   11   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Properties and parameters   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nArtist's rendition of the Earth's  plasma fountain , showing oxygen, helium, and hydrogen ions that gush into space from regions near the Earth's poles.

[ 4 ]    \n \n \n  Definition   [  edit  ]   \n Plasma is loosely described as an electrically neutral medium of positive and negative particles (i.e. the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero). It is important to note that although they are unbound, these particles are not \u2018free\u2019. When the charges move they generate electrical currents with magnetic fields, and as a result, they are affected by each other\u2019s fields. This governs their collective behavior with many degrees of freedom.   [ 3 ]      [ 5 ]    A definition can have three criteria:   [ 6 ]      [ 7 ]    \n \n  The plasma approximation : Charged particles must be close enough together that each particle influences many nearby charged particles, rather than just interacting with the closest particle (these collective effects are a distinguishing feature of a plasma). The plasma approximation is valid when the number of charge carriers within the sphere of influence (called the  Debye sphere  whose radius is the  Debye screening length ) of a particular particle is higher than unity to provide collective behavior of the charged particles. The average number of particles in the Debye sphere is given by the  plasma parameter , \"\u039b\" (the  Greek  letter  Lambda ). \n  Bulk interactions : The Debye screening length (defined above) is short compared to the physical size of the plasma. This criterion means that interactions in the bulk of the plasma are more important than those at its edges, where boundary effects may take place. When this criterion is satisfied, the plasma is quasineutral. \n  Plasma frequency : The electron plasma frequency (measuring  plasma oscillations  of the electrons) is large compared to the electron-neutral collision frequency (measuring frequency of collisions between electrons and neutral particles). When this condition is valid, electrostatic interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas kinetics. \n \n  Ranges of parameters   [  edit  ]   \n Plasma parameters can take on values varying by many  orders of magnitude , but the properties of plasmas with apparently disparate parameters may be very similar (see  plasma scaling ). The following chart considers only conventional atomic plasmas and not exotic phenomena like  quark gluon plasmas : \n \n    \n \n     \n Range of plasmas . Density increases upwards, temperature increases towards the right. The free electrons in a metal may be considered an electron plasma.

The term \"plasma density\" by itself usually refers to the \"electron density\", that is, the number of free electrons per unit volume. The  degree of ionization  of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons, and is controlled mostly by the temperature. Even a partially ionized gas in which as little as 1% of the particles are ionized can have the characteristics of a plasma (i.e., response to magnetic fields and high  electrical conductivity ). The degree of ionization,  \u03b1 , is defined as  \u03b1  =  n  i /( n  i  +  n  a ) where  n  i  is the number density of ions and  n  a  is the number density of neutral atoms. The  electron density  is related to this by the average charge state &lt;Z&gt; of the ions through  n  e  = &lt;Z&gt;  n  i  where  n  e  is the number density of electrons. \n  Temperatures   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  Nonthermal plasma  \n Plasma temperature is commonly measured in  kelvin  or  electronvolts  and is, informally, a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle. Very high temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the \"electron temperature\" relative to the  ionization energy  (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the  Saha equation . At low temperatures, ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states\u2014atoms   [ 10 ]   \u2014and the plasma will eventually become a gas. \n In most cases the electrons are close enough to  thermal equilibrium  that their temperature is relatively well-defined, even when there is a significant deviation from a  Maxwellian  energy  distribution function , for example, due to  UV radiation , energetic particles, or strong  electric fields . Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the \"ion temperature\" may be very different from (usually lower than) the \" electron temperature \". This is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the  ambient temperature . \n  Thermal vs. non-thermal plasmas   [  edit  ]   \n Based on the relative temperatures of the electrons, ions and neutrals, plasmas are classified as \"thermal\" or \"non-thermal\". Thermal plasmas have electrons and the heavy particles at the same temperature, i.e., they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. Non-thermal plasmas on the other hand have the ions and neutrals at a much lower temperature (sometimes room temperature), whereas electrons are much \"hotter\" (T e  &gt;&gt; T neutrals ). \n A plasma is sometimes referred to as being \"hot\" if it is nearly fully ionized, or \"cold\" if only a small fraction (for example 1%) of the gas molecules are ionized, but other definitions of the terms \"hot plasma\" and \"cold plasma\" are common. Even in a \"cold\" plasma, the electron temperature is still typically several thousand degrees Celsius. Plasmas utilized in \"plasma technology\" (\"technological plasmas\") are usually cold plasmas in the sense that only a small fraction of the gas molecules are ionized. \n  Potentials   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Lightning  is an example of plasma present at Earth's surface. Typically, lightning discharges 30,000 amperes at up to 100 million volts, and emits light, radio waves, X-rays and even gamma rays.   [ 11 ]    Plasma temperatures in lightning can approach 28,000 kelvin and electron densities may exceed 10 24  m \u22123 . \n \n \n Since plasmas are very good  electrical conductors , electric potentials play an important role. The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles, independent of the question of how it can be measured, is called the \"plasma potential\", or the \"space potential\". If an electrode is inserted into a plasma, its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a  Debye sheath . The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small. This results in the important concept of \"quasineutrality\", which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma ( n  e \u00a0=\u00a0&lt;Z&gt; n  i ), but on the scale of the Debye length there can be charge imbalance. In the special case that   double layers   are formed, the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths. \n The magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net  charge density . A common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the  Boltzmann relation : \n \n   \n \n Differentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density: \n \n   \n \n It is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it must be very small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive  electrostatic force . \n In  astrophysical  plasmas,  Debye screening  prevents  electric fields  from directly affecting the plasma over large distances, i.e., greater than the  Debye length . However, the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate and can be affected by  magnetic fields . This can and does cause extremely complex behavior, such as the generation of plasma double layers, an object that separates charge over a few tens of  Debye lengths . The dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated  magnetic fields  are studied in the  academic discipline  of  magnetohydrodynamics . \n  Magnetization   [  edit  ]   \n Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e., \u03c9 ce /\u03bd coll  &gt; 1, where \u03c9 ce  is the \"electron gyrofrequency\" and \u03bd coll  is the \"electron collision rate\". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are   anisotropic  , meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by  E  = \u2212 v  \u00d7  B  (where  E  is the electric field,  v  is the velocity, and  B  is the magnetic field), and is not affected by  Debye shielding .   [ 12 ]    \n  Comparison of plasma and gas phases   [  edit  ]   \n Plasma is often called the  fourth state of matter  after solid, liquids and gases.   [ 13 ]      [ 14 ]    It is distinct from these and other lower-energy  states of matter . Although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume, it differs in a number of ways, including the following: \n \n \n Property \n Gas \n Plasma \n \n \n  Electrical conductivity  \n  Very low : Air is an excellent insulator until it breaks down into plasma at electric field strengths above 30 kilovolts per centimeter.   [ 15 ]    \n  Usually very high : For many purposes, the conductivity of a plasma may be treated as infinite. \n \n \n Independently acting species \n  One : All gas particles behave in a similar way, influenced by  gravity  and by  collisions  with one another. \n  Two or three :  Electrons ,  ions ,  protons  and  neutrons  can be distinguished by the sign and value of their  charge  so that they behave independently in many circumstances, with different bulk velocities and temperatures, allowing phenomena such as new types of  waves  and  instabilities . \n \n \n Velocity distribution \n   Maxwellian  : Collisions usually lead to a Maxwellian velocity distribution of all gas particles, with very few relatively fast particles. \n  Often non-Maxwellian : Collisional interactions are often weak in hot plasmas and external forcing can drive the plasma far from local equilibrium and lead to a significant population of unusually fast particles. \n \n \n Interactions \n  Binary : Two-particle collisions are the rule, three-body collisions extremely rare. \n  Collective : Waves, or organized motion of plasma, are very important because the particles can interact at long ranges through the electric and magnetic forces. \n \n \n  Common plasmas   [  edit  ]   \n Further information:  Astrophysical plasma ,\u00a0 Interstellar medium ,\u00a0and\u00a0 Intergalactic space  \n Plasmas are by far the most common  phase of ordinary matter  in the universe, both by mass and by volume.   [ 16 ]    Our Sun, and all  stars , are made of plasma, much of  interstellar space  is filled with a plasma, albeit a very sparse one, and  intergalactic space  too. In our solar system,  interplanetary space  is filled with the plasma of the  Solar Wind  that extends from the Sun out to the  heliopause . Even  black holes , which are not directly visible, are fuelled by accreting ionising matter (i.e. plasma),   [ 17 ]    and they are associated with astrophysical jets of luminous ejected plasma,   [ 18 ]    such as  M87's jet  that extends 5,000 light-years.   [ 19 ]    \n Dust and small grains within a plasma will also pick up a net negative charge, so that they in turn may act like a very heavy negative ion component of the plasma (see  dusty plasmas ). \n The current consensus is that about 96% of the total energy density in the universe is not plasma or any other form of ordinary matter, but a combination of  cold dark matter  and  dark energy . In our Solar System, however, the density of ordinary matter is much higher than average and much higher than that of either dark matter or dark energy. The planet  Jupiter  accounts for most of the  non -plasma, only about 0.1% of the mass and 10 \u221215 % of the volume within the orbit of  Pluto . \n  \n \n Common forms of plasma \n \n Artificially produced \n  Terrestrial  plasmas \n Space and  astrophysical  plasmas \n \n \n \n \n Those found in  plasma displays , including TVs \n Inside  fluorescent lamps  (low energy lighting),  neon signs    [ 20 ]    \n Rocket exhaust and  ion thrusters  \n The area in front of a  spacecraft 's  heat shield  during re-entry into the  atmosphere  \n Inside a corona discharge  ozone  generator \n  Fusion energy  research \n The  electric arc  in an  arc lamp , an arc  welder  or  plasma torch  \n Plasma ball (sometimes called a plasma sphere or  plasma globe ) \n Arcs produced by  Tesla coils  (resonant air core transformer or disruptor coil that produces arcs similar to lightning, but with  alternating current  rather than  static electricity ) \n Plasmas used in  semiconductor device fabrication  including  reactive-ion etching ,  sputtering ,  surface cleaning  and  plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition  \n  Laser -produced plasmas (LPP), found when high power lasers interact with materials. \n  Inductively coupled plasmas  (ICP), formed typically in  argon  gas for optical emission  spectroscopy  or  mass spectrometry  \n Magnetically induced plasmas (MIP), typically produced using microwaves as a resonant coupling method \n  Static electric sparks  \n \n \n \n \n  Lightning  \n  St. Elmo's fire  \n  Upper-atmospheric lightning  (e.g. Blue jets, Blue starters, Gigantic jets, ELVES) \n  Sprites  \n The  ionosphere  \n The  plasmasphere  \n The  polar aurorae  \n Some  flames    [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]    \n The  polar wind , a plasma fountain \n \n \n \n \n The  Sun  and other  stars  \n(plasmas heated by  nuclear fusion ) \n The  solar wind  \n The  interplanetary medium  \n(space between planets) \n The  interstellar medium  \n(space between star systems) \n The  Intergalactic medium  \n(space between galaxies) \n The  Io - Jupiter   flux tube  \n  Accretion discs  \n Interstellar  nebulae  \n  Cometary ion tail  \n \n \n \n \n  Complex plasma phenomena   [  edit  ]   \n Although the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple, plasma behavior is extraordinarily varied and subtle: the emergence of unexpected behavior from a simple model is a typical feature of a  complex system . Such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behavior and cannot typically be described either by simple, smooth, mathematical functions, or by pure randomness. The spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity. The features are interesting, for example, because they are very sharp, spatially intermittent (the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves), or have a  fractal  form. Many of these features were first studied in the laboratory, and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe. Examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include: \n  Filamentation   [  edit  ]   \n Striations or string-like structures,   [ 23 ]    also known as  birkeland currents , are seen in many plasmas, like the  plasma ball , the  aurora ,   [ 24 ]     lightning ,   [ 25 ]     electric arcs ,  solar flares ,   [ 26 ]    and  supernova remnants .   [ 27 ]    They are sometimes associated with larger current densities, and the interaction with the magnetic field can form a  magnetic rope  structure.   [ 28 ]    High power microwave breakdown at atmospheric pressure also leads to the formation of filamentary structures.   [ 29 ]    (See also  Plasma pinch ) \n Filamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse. At high powers, the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam, where the laser is brighter than at the edges, causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more. The tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness (irradiance) that forms a plasma. The plasma has an index of refraction lower than one, and causes a defocusing of the laser beam. The interplay of the focusing index of refraction, and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be  micrometers  to kilometers in length.   [ 30 ]    One interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to defocusing effects of the ionized electrons.   [ 31 ]    (See also  Filament propagation ) \n  Shocks or double layers   [  edit  ]   \n Plasma properties change rapidly (within a few  Debye lengths ) across a two-dimensional sheet in the presence of a (moving) shock or (stationary)  double layer . Double layers involve localized charge separation, which causes a large potential difference across the layer, but does not generate an electric field outside the layer. Double layers separate adjacent plasma regions with different physical characteristics, and are often found in current carrying plasmas. They accelerate both ions and electrons. \n  Electric fields and circuits   [  edit  ]   \n Quasineutrality of a plasma requires that plasma currents close on themselves in electric circuits. Such circuits follow  Kirchhoff's circuit laws  and possess a  resistance  and  inductance . These circuits must generally be treated as a strongly coupled system, with the behavior in each plasma region dependent on the entire circuit. It is this strong coupling between system elements, together with nonlinearity, which may lead to complex behavior. Electrical circuits in plasmas store inductive (magnetic) energy, and should the circuit be disrupted, for example, by a plasma instability, the inductive energy will be released as plasma heating and acceleration. This is a common explanation for the heating that takes place in the  solar corona . Electric currents, and in particular, magnetic-field-aligned electric currents (which are sometimes generically referred to as \" Birkeland currents \"), are also observed in the Earth's aurora, and in plasma filaments. \n  Cellular structure   [  edit  ]   \n Narrow sheets with sharp gradients may separate regions with different properties such as magnetization, density and temperature, resulting in cell-like regions. Examples include the  magnetosphere ,  heliosphere , and  heliospheric current sheet .  Hannes Alfv\u00e9n  wrote: \"From the cosmological point of view, the most important new space research discovery is probably the cellular structure of space. As has been seen in every region of space accessible to in situ measurements, there are a number of 'cell walls', sheets of electric currents, which divide space into compartments with different magnetization, temperature, density, etc.\"   [ 32 ]    \n  Critical ionization velocity   [  edit  ]   \n The  critical ionization velocity  is the relative velocity between an ionized plasma and a neutral gas, above which a runaway ionization process takes place. The critical ionization process is a quite general mechanism for the conversion of the kinetic energy of a rapidly streaming gas into ionization and plasma thermal energy. Critical phenomena in general are typical of complex systems, and may lead to sharp spatial or temporal features. \n  Ultracold plasma   [  edit  ]   \n Ultracold plasmas are created in a  magneto-optical trap  (MOT) by trapping and cooling neutral  atoms , to temperatures of 1\u00a0 mK  or lower, and then using another  laser  to  ionize  the atoms by giving each of the outermost electrons just enough energy to escape the electrical attraction of its parent ion. \n One advantage of ultracold plasmas are their well characterized and tunable initial conditions, including their size and electron temperature. By adjusting the wavelength of the ionizing laser, the kinetic energy of the liberated electrons can be tuned as low as 0.1 K, a limit set by the frequency bandwidth of the laser pulse. The ions inherit the millikelvin temperatures of the neutral atoms, but are quickly heated through a process known as disorder induced heating (DIH). This type of non-equilibrium ultracold plasma evolves rapidly, and displays many other interesting phenomena.   [ 33 ]    \n One of the metastable states of a strongly nonideal plasma is  Rydberg matter , which forms upon condensation of excited atoms. \n   Non-neutral plasma    [  edit  ]   \n The strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal (\"quasineutrality\"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a  non-neutral plasma . In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged  particle beams , an electron cloud in a  Penning trap  and positron plasmas.   [ 34 ]    \n  Dusty plasma and grain plasma   [  edit  ]   \n A  dusty plasma  contains tiny charged particles of dust (typically found in space). The dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other. A plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma. Under laboratory conditions, dusty plasmas are also called  complex plasmas .   [ 35 ]    \n  Impermeable plasma   [  edit  ]   \n Impermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by  Hannes Alfv\u00e9n  in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of  fusion  plasma from the reactor walls.   [ 36 ]    However later it was found that the external  magnetic fields  in this configuration could induce  kink instabilities  in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.   [ 37 ]    In 2013, a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no  magnetic confinement  using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high-pressure, the passive effect of plasma on  synthesis  of different  nanostructures  clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of  ions  at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex  nanomaterials .   [ 38 ]    \n  Mathematical descriptions   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nThe complex self-constricting magnetic field lines and current paths in a field-aligned  Birkeland current  that can develop in a plasma.   [ 39 ]    \n \n \n Main article:  Plasma modeling  \n To completely describe the state of a plasma, we would need to write down all the particle locations and velocities and describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region. However, it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma. Therefore, plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions, of which there are two main types: \n  Fluid model   [  edit  ]   \n Fluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see  Plasma parameters ). One simple fluid model,  magnetohydrodynamics , treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of  Maxwell's equations  and the  Navier\u2013Stokes equations . A more general description is the  two-fluid plasma  picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a  Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution . Because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or  double layers , nor resolve wave-particle effects. \n  Kinetic model   [  edit  ]   \n Kinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a  Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution . A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the  particle-in-cell  (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The  Vlasov equation  may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field. In magnetized plasmas, a  gyrokinetic  approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation. \n  Artificial plasmas   [  edit  ]   \n Most artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields. Plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by: \n \n The type of power source used to generate the plasma\u2014DC, RF and microwave \n The pressure they operate at\u2014vacuum pressure (&lt; 10\u00a0mTorr or 1 Pa), moderate pressure (~ 1\u00a0Torr or 100 Pa), atmospheric pressure (760\u00a0Torr or 100 kPa) \n The degree of ionization within the plasma\u2014fully, partially, or weakly ionized \n The temperature relationships within the plasma\u2014thermal plasma ( T e  \u00a0=  T  ion \u00a0=  T  gas ), non-thermal or \"cold\" plasma ( T e  \u00a0&gt;&gt;  T  ion \u00a0=  T  gas ) \n The electrode configuration used to generate the plasma \n The magnetization of the particles within the plasma\u2014magnetized (both ion and electrons are trapped in  Larmor orbits  by the magnetic field), partially magnetized (the electrons but not the ions are trapped by the magnetic field), non-magnetized (the magnetic field is too weak to trap the particles in orbits but may generate  Lorentz forces ) \n The application. \n \n  Generation of artificial plasma   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nArtificial plasma produced in air by a  Jacob's Ladder  \n \n \n Just like the many uses of plasma, there are several means for its generation, however, one principle is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it.   [ 40 ]    For this case, plasma is generated when an  electrical current  is applied across a  dielectric gas  or fluid (an electrically  non-conducting  material) as can be seen in the image below, which shows a  discharge tube  as a simple example ( DC  used for simplicity).     \n \n    \n \n     \nCascade process of ionization. Electrons are \u2018e\u2212\u2019, neutral atoms \u2018o\u2019, and cations \u2018+\u2019. \n \n \n \n    \n \n     \nAvalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionisation event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionising electron and the liberated electron. \n \n \n The  potential difference  and subsequent  electric field  pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the  anode  (positive electrode) while the  cathode  (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus.   [ 41 ]    As the  voltage  increases, the current stresses the material (by  electric polarization ) beyond its  dielectric limit  (termed strength) into a stage of  electrical breakdown , marked by an  electric spark , where the material transforms from being an  insulator  into a  conductor  (as it becomes increasingly  ionized ). The underlying process is the  Townsend avalanche , where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as can be seen in the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only \u201cafter about 20 successive sets of collisions\u201d,   [ 42 ]    mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions). \n  Electric arc   [  edit  ]   \n With ample current density and ionization, this forms a luminous  electric arc  (a continuous electric discharge similar to  lightning ) between the electrodes.   [ Note 1 ]     Electrical resistance  along the continuous electric arc creates  heat , which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per the sequence:  solid - liquid - gas -plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma.   [ Note 2 ]    A thermal plasma is in  thermal equilibrium , which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated,  electrical energy  is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by  elastic collision  (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.   [ 43 ]      [ Note 3 ]    \n  Examples of industrial/commercial plasma   [  edit  ]   \n Because of their sizable temperature and density ranges, plasmas find applications in many fields of research, technology and industry. For example, in: industrial and extractive  metallurgy ,   [ 43 ]    surface treatments such as  plasma spraying  (coating),  etching  in microelectronics,   [ 44 ]    metal cutting   [ 45 ]    and  welding ; as well as in everyday  vehicle exhaust cleanup  and  fluorescent / luminescent  lamps,   [ 40 ]    while even playing a part in  supersonic combustion engines  for  aerospace engineering .   [ 46 ]    \n  Low-pressure discharges   [  edit  ]   \n \n   Glow discharge  plasmas : non-thermal plasmas generated by the application of DC or low frequency RF (&lt;100\u00a0kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; this is the type of plasma generated within  fluorescent light  tubes.   [ 47 ]    \n   Capacitively coupled plasma  (CCP) : similar to glow discharge plasmas, but generated with high frequency RF electric fields, typically  13.56\u00a0MHz . These differ from glow discharges in that the sheaths are much less intense. These are widely used in the microfabrication and integrated circuit manufacturing industries for plasma etching and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition.   [ 48 ]    \n   Cascaded Arc Plasma Source  : a device to produce low temperature (~1eV) high density plasmas. \n   Inductively coupled plasma  (ICP) : similar to a CCP and with similar applications but the electrode consists of a coil wrapped around the chamber where plasma is formed.   [ 49 ]    \n   Wave heated plasma  : similar to CCP and ICP in that it is typically RF (or microwave). Examples include  helicon discharge  and  electron cyclotron resonance  (ECR).   [ 50 ]    \n \n  Atmospheric pressure   [  edit  ]   \n \n   Arc discharge :  this is a high power thermal discharge of very high temperature (~10,000 K). It can be generated using various power supplies. It is commonly used in  metallurgical  processes. For example, it is used to smelt minerals containing Al 2 O 3  to produce  aluminium . \n   Corona discharge :  this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltage to sharp electrode tips. It is commonly used in  ozone  generators and particle precipitators. \n   Dielectric barrier discharge  (DBD):  this is a non-thermal discharge generated by the application of high voltages across small gaps wherein a non-conducting coating prevents the transition of the plasma discharge into an arc. It is often mislabeled 'Corona' discharge in industry and has similar application to corona discharges. It is also widely used in the web treatment of fabrics.   [ 51 ]    The application of the discharge to synthetic fabrics and plastics functionalizes the surface and allows for paints, glues and similar materials to adhere.   [ 52 ]    \n   Capacitive discharge :  this is a  nonthermal plasma  generated by the application of RF power (e.g.,  13.56\u00a0MHz ) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance on the order of 1\u00a0cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.   [ 53 ]    \n \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n Plasma was first identified in a  Crookes tube , and so described by  Sir William Crookes  in 1879 (he called it \"radiant matter\").   [ 54 ]    The nature of the Crookes tube \" cathode ray \" matter was subsequently identified by British physicist  Sir J.J. Thomson  in 1897.   [ 55 ]    The term \"plasma\" was coined by  Irving Langmuir  in 1928,   [ 56 ]    perhaps because the glowing discharge molds itself to the shape of the Crooks tube ( Gr.  \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u00a0\u2013 a thing moulded or formed).   [ 57 ]    Langmuir described his observations as: \n \n Except near the electrodes, where there are  sheaths  containing very few electrons, the ionized gas contains ions and electrons in about equal numbers so that the resultant space charge is very small. We shall use the name  plasma  to describe this region containing balanced charges of ions and electrons.

The voltage rises to its maximum value in the saturation stage, and thereafter it undergoes fluctuations of the various stages; while the current progressively increases throughout.   [ 42 ]     \n    ^     Across literature, there appears to be no strict definition on where the boundary is between a gas and plasma. Nevertheless, it is enough to say that at 2000\u00b0C the gas molecules become atomized, and ionized at 3000\u00b0C and \"in this state, [the] gas has a liquid like viscosity at atmospheric pressure and the free electric charges confer relatively high electrical conductivities that can approach those of metals.\u201d   [ 43 ]     \n    ^     Note that non-thermal, or non-equilibrium plasmas are not as ionized and have lower energy densities, and thus the temperature is not dispersed evenly among the particles, where some heavy ones remain \u2018cold\u2019.  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^      \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 , Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott,  A Greek-English Lexicon , on Perseus  \n    ^      Luo, Q-Z; D'Angelo, N; Merlino, R.

Essentially, all of the visible light from space comes from stars, which are plasmas with a temperature such that they radiate strongly at visible wavelengths. Most of the ordinary (or  baryonic ) matter in the universe, however, is found in the  intergalactic medium , which is also a plasma, but much hotter, so that it radiates primarily as X-rays. The current scientific consensus is that about 96% of the total energy density in the universe is not plasma or any other form of ordinary matter, but a combination of  cold dark matter  and  dark energy .  \n    ^     M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, P\u00e9ter (2010)  The High Energy Universe: Ultra-High Energy Events in Astrophysics and Cosmology , Publisher Cambridge University Press,  ISBN 978-0-521-51700-3 ,  p. 99 .  \n    ^     Raine, Derek J. and Thomas, Edwin George (2010)  Black Holes: An Introduction , Publisher: Imperial College Press,  ISBN 978-1-84816-382-9 ,  p. 160   \n    ^     Nemiroff, Robert and Bonnell, Jerry (11 December 2004)  Astronomy Picture of the Day , nasa.gov  \n    ^      IPPEX Glossary of Fusion Terms .
