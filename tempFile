Searches can be based on metadata or on full-text (or other content-based) indexing. \n Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called \" information overload \". Many universities and  public libraries  use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents.  Web search engines  are the most visible  IR applications . \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Overview   \n   2   History   \n   3   Model types  \n \n   3.1   First dimension: mathematical basis   \n   3.2   Second dimension: properties of the model   \n \n \n   4   Performance and correctness measures  \n \n   4.1   Precision   \n   4.2   Recall   \n   4.3   Fall-out   \n   4.4   F-measure   \n   4.5   Average precision   \n   4.6   R-Precision   \n   4.7   Mean average precision   \n   4.8   Discounted cumulative gain   \n   4.9   Other Measures   \n   4.10   Timeline   \n \n \n   5   Awards in the field   \n   6   See also   \n   7   References   \n   8   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Overview   [  edit  ]   \n An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a  query  into the system. Queries are formal statements of  information needs , for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of  relevancy . \n An object is an entity that is represented by information in a  database . User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the  application  the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,   [ 1 ]    audio,   [ 2 ]     mind maps    [ 3 ]    or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata. \n Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.   [ 4 ]    \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \u201c \n But do you know that, although I have kept the diary [on a phonograph] for months past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular part of it in case I wanted to look it up? \n \u201d \n \n \n \n \u2014 Dr Seward ,  Bram Stoker 's   Dracula  , 1897 \n \n \n \n The idea of using computers to search for relevant pieces of information was popularized in the article   As We May Think   by  Vannevar Bush  in 1945.   [ 5 ]    The first automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s. By 1970 several different techniques had been shown to perform well on small  text corpora  such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).   [ 5 ]    Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s. \n In 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the  National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST), cosponsored the  Text Retrieval Conference  (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that  scale  to huge corpora. The introduction of web  search engines  has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further. \n  Model types   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nCategorization of IR-models (translated from  German entry , original source  Dominik Kuropka ). \n \n \n For effectively retrieving relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporate a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model. \n  First dimension: mathematical basis   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Set-theoretic  models represent documents as sets of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:\n \n  Standard Boolean model  \n  Extended Boolean model  \n  Fuzzy retrieval  \n \n \n  Algebraic models  represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.\n \n  Vector space model  \n  Generalized vector space model  \n  (Enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model  \n  Extended Boolean model  \n  Latent semantic indexing  aka  latent semantic analysis  \n \n \n  Probabilistic models  treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like the  Bayes' theorem  are often used in these models.\n \n  Binary Independence Model  \n  Probabilistic relevance model  on which is based the  okapi (BM25)  relevance function \n  Uncertain inference  \n  Language models  \n  Divergence-from-randomness model  \n  Latent Dirichlet allocation  \n \n \n  Feature-based retrieval models  view documents as vectors of values of  feature functions  (or just  features ) and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score, typically by  learning to rank  methods. Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query, and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just a yet another feature. \n \n  Second dimension: properties of the model   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Models without term-interdependencies  treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the  orthogonality  assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an  independency  assumption for term variables. \n  Models with immanent term interdependencies  allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by  dimensional reduction ) from the  co-occurrence  of those terms in the whole set of documents. \n  Models with transcendent term interdependencies  allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They relay an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example a human or sophisticated algorithms.) \n \n  Performance and correctness measures   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Precision and recall  \n Many different measures for evaluating the performance of information retrieval systems have been proposed. The measures require a collection of documents and a query. All common measures described here assume a ground truth notion of relevancy: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice queries may be  ill-posed  and there may be different shades of relevancy. \n  Precision   [  edit  ]   \n Precision is the fraction of the documents retrieved that are  relevant  to the user's information need. \n \n   \n \n In  binary classification , precision is analogous to  positive predictive value . Precision takes all retrieved documents into account. It can also be evaluated at a given cut-off rank, considering only the topmost results returned by the system. This measure is called  precision at n  or  P@n . \n Note that the meaning and usage of \"precision\" in the field of Information Retrieval differs from the definition of  accuracy and precision  within other branches of science and  statistics . \n  Recall   [  edit  ]   \n Recall is the fraction of the documents that are relevant to the query that are successfully retrieved. \n \n   \n \n In binary classification, recall is often called  sensitivity . So it can be looked at as  the probability that a relevant document is retrieved by the query . \n It is trivial to achieve recall of 100% by returning all documents in response to any query. Therefore recall alone is not enough but one needs to measure the number of non-relevant documents also, for example by computing the precision. \n  Fall-out   [  edit  ]   \n The proportion of non-relevant documents that are retrieved, out of all non-relevant documents available: \n \n   \n \n In binary classification, fall-out is closely related to  specificity  and is equal to  . It can be looked at as  the probability that a non-relevant document is retrieved by the query . \n It is trivial to achieve fall-out of 0% by returning zero documents in response to any query. \n  F-measure   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  F-score  \n The weighted  harmonic mean  of precision and recall, the traditional F-measure or balanced F-score is: \n \n   \n \n This is also known as the   measure, because recall and precision are evenly weighted. \n The general formula for non-negative real   is: \n \n  . \n \n Two other commonly used F measures are the   measure, which weights recall twice as much as precision, and the   measure, which weights precision twice as much as recall. \n The F-measure was derived by van Rijsbergen (1979) so that   \"measures the effectiveness of retrieval with respect to a user who attaches   times as much importance to recall as precision\". It is based on van Rijsbergen's effectiveness measure  . Their relationship is   where  . \n  Average precision   [  edit  ]   \n Precision and recall are single-value metrics based on the whole list of documents returned by the system. For systems that return a ranked sequence of documents, it is desirable to also consider the order in which the returned documents are presented. By computing a precision and recall at every position in the ranked sequence of documents, one can plot a precision-recall curve, plotting precision   as a function of recall  . Average precision computes the average value of   over the interval from   to  :   [ 6 ]    \n \n   \n \n That is the area under the precision-recall curve. This integral is in practice replaced with a finite sum over every position in the ranked sequence of documents: \n \n   \n \n where   is the rank in the sequence of retrieved documents,   is the number of retrieved documents,   is the precision at cut-off   in the list, and   is the change in recall from items   to  .   [ 6 ]    \n This finite sum is equivalent to: \n \n   \n \n where   is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank   is a relevant document, zero otherwise.   [ 7 ]    Note that the average is over all relevant documents and the relevant documents not retrieved get a precision score of zero. \n Some authors choose to interpolate the   function to reduce the impact of \"wiggles\" in the curve.   [ 8 ]      [ 9 ]    For example, the PASCAL Visual Object Classes challenge (a benchmark for computer vision object detection) computes average precision by averaging the precision over a set of evenly spaced recall levels {0, 0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0}:   [ 8 ]      [ 9 ]    \n \n   \n \n where   is an interpolated precision that takes the maximum precision over all recalls greater than  : \n \n  . \n \n An alternative is to derive an analytical   function by assuming a particular parametric distribution for the underlying decision values. For example, a  binormal precision-recall curve  can be obtained by assuming decision values in both classes to follow a Gaussian distribution.   [ 10 ]    \n  R-Precision   [  edit  ]   \n Precision at  R -th position in the ranking of results for a query that has  R  relevant documents. This measure is highly correlated to Average Precision. Also, Precision is equal to Recall at the  R -th position. \n  Mean average precision   [  edit  ]   \n Mean average precision for a set of queries is the mean of the average precision scores for each query. \n \n   \n \n where  Q  is the number of queries. \n  Discounted cumulative gain   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Discounted cumulative gain  \n DCG uses a graded relevance scale of documents from the result set to evaluate the usefulness, or gain, of a document based on its position in the result list. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result. \n The DCG accumulated at a particular rank position   is defined as: \n \n   \n \n Since result set may vary in size among different queries or systems, to compare performances the normalised version of DCG uses an ideal DCG. To this end, it sorts documents of a result list by relevance, producing an ideal DCG at position p ( ), which normalizes the score: \n \n   \n \n The nDCG values for all queries can be averaged to obtain a measure of the average performance of a ranking algorithm. Note that in a perfect ranking algorithm, the   will be the same as the   producing an nDCG of 1.0. All nDCG calculations are then relative values on the interval 0.0 to 1.0 and so are cross-query comparable. \n  Other Measures   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Mean reciprocal rank  \n  Spearman's rank correlation coefficient  \n \n  Timeline   [  edit  ]   \n \n Before the  1900s \n \n  1801 :  Joseph Marie Jacquard  invents the  Jacquard loom , the first machine to use punched cards to control a sequence of operations. \n  1880s :  Herman Hollerith  invents an electro-mechanical data tabulator using punch cards as a machine readable medium. \n  1890  Hollerith  cards ,  keypunches  and  tabulators  used to process the  1890 US Census  data. \n \n \n  1920s-1930s \n \n  Emanuel Goldberg  submits patents for his \"Statistical Machine\u201d a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilmed documents. \n \n \n  1940s\u20131950s \n \n  late 1940s : The US military confronted problems of indexing and retrieval of wartime scientific research documents captured from Germans.\n \n  1945 :  Vannevar Bush 's   As We May Think   appeared in   Atlantic Monthly  . \n  1947 :  Hans Peter Luhn  (research engineer at IBM since 1941) began work on a mechanized punch card-based system for searching chemical compounds. \n \n \n  1950s : Growing concern in the US for a \"science gap\" with the USSR motivated, encouraged funding and provided a backdrop for mechanized literature searching systems (Allen Kent  et al. ) and the invention of citation indexing ( Eugene Garfield ). \n  1950 : The term \"information retrieval\" appears to have been coined by  Calvin Mooers .

[ 1 ]    Practitioners within the field study the application and usage of knowledge in  organizations , along with the interaction between people, organizations and any existing  information systems , with the aim of creating, replacing, improving, or understanding information systems. Information science is often (mistakenly) considered a branch of  computer science . However, it is actually a broad, interdisciplinary field, incorporating not only aspects of computer science, but often diverse fields such as  archival science ,  cognitive science ,  commerce ,  communications ,  law ,  library science ,  museology ,  management ,  mathematics ,  philosophy ,  public policy , and the  social sciences . \n Information science should not be confused with  information theory  or  library science . Information theory is the study of a particular mathematical concept of information, while library science is a field related to  libraries  which uses some of the principles of information science. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Foundations  \n \n   1.1   Scope and approach   \n   1.2   Definitions of information science   \n   1.3   Philosophy of information   \n   1.4   Ontology   \n \n \n   2   Careers  \n \n   2.1   Information scientist   \n   2.2   Information professional   \n \n \n   3   History  \n \n   3.1   Early beginnings   \n   3.2   19th century   \n   3.3   European documentation   \n   3.4   Transition to modern information science   \n \n \n   4   Research vectors and applications  \n \n   4.1   Information access   \n   4.2   Information architecture   \n   4.3   Information management   \n   4.4   Information retrieval  \n \n   4.4.1   Information seeking   \n \n \n   4.5   Information society   \n   4.6   Knowledge representation and reasoning   \n \n \n   5   See also   \n   6   References   \n   7   Further reading   \n   8   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Foundations   [  edit  ]   \n  Scope and approach   [  edit  ]   \n Information science focuses on understanding  problems  from the perspective of the stakeholders involved and then applying information and other technologies as needed. In other words, it tackles systemic problems first rather than individual pieces of  technology  within that system. In this respect, one can see information science as a response to  technological determinism , the belief that technology \"develops by its own laws, that it realizes its own potential, limited only by the material resources available and the creativity of its developers. It must therefore be regarded as an autonomous system controlling and ultimately permeating all other subsystems of society.\"   [ 2 ]    \n Many universities have entire colleges, departments or schools devoted to the study of information science, while numerous information-science scholars work in disciplines such as  communication ,  computer science ,  law ,  library science , and  sociology . Several institutions have formed an I-School Caucus (see   List of I-Schools  ), but numerous others besides these also have comprehensive information foci. \n Within information science, current issues as of 2013  [update]   include: \n \n  human\u2013computer interaction  \n  groupware  \n the  semantic web  \n  value-sensitive design  \n  iterative design  processes \n the ways people generate, use and find information \n \n  Definitions of information science   [  edit  ]   \n An early definition of Information science (going back to 1968, the year when  American Documentation Institute  shifted name to  American Society for Information Science and Technology ) is: \n \n \u201cInformation science is that discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. It is concerned with that body of knowledge relating to the origination, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, interpretation, transmission, transformation, and utilization of information. This includes the investigation of information representations in both natural and artificial systems, the use of codes for efficient message transmission, and the study of information processing devices and techniques such as computers and their programming systems. It is an interdisciplinary science derived from and related to such fields as mathematics, logic, linguistics, psychology, computer technology, operations research, the graphic arts, communications, library science, management, and other similar fields. It has both a pure science component, which inquires into the subject without regard to its application, and an applied science component, which develops services and products\u201d (Borko, 1968, p.3).   [ 3 ]    \n \n Some authors use  informatics  as a synonym for  information science . This is especially true when related to the concept developed by  A. I. Mikhailov  and other Soviet authors in the mid sixties, which suggested that informatics is a discipline related to the study of Scientific Information.   [ 4 ]    Informatics is difficult to precisely define because of the rapidly evolving and  interdisciplinary  nature of the field. \n Regional differences and international terminology complicate the problem. Some people note that much of what is called \"Informatics\" today was once called \"Information Science\" at least in fields such as Medical Informatics. For example, when library scientists began also to use the phrase \"Information Science\" to refer to their work, the term informatics emerged: \n \n In the United States as a response by computer scientists to distinguish their work from that of library science, and \n In Britain as a term for a science of information that studies natural, as well as artificial or engineered, information-processing systems. \n \n Another term that is debated to be a synonym for \"information studies\" is \"information systems\".  Brian Campbell Vickery 's  Information Systems  (1973) places information systems within IS. Ellis, Allen, &amp; Wilson (1999) is, on the other hand a bibliometric investigation describing the relation between two  different  fields: \"Information science\" and \"information systems\". \n  Philosophy of information   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Philosophy of information  \n Philosophy of information (PI) studies conceptual issues arising at the intersection of  computer science ,  information technology , and  philosophy . It includes the investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of  information , including its dynamics, utilisation and sciences, as well as the elaboration and application of information-theoretic and computational methodologies to its philosophical problems.   [ 5 ]    \n  Ontology   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ontology (information science)  \n In computer science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a  domain , and the relationships between those concepts. It can be used to  reason  about the entities within that domain and may be used to describe the domain. \n More specifically, an ontology is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. Exactly what is provided around these varies, but they are the essentials of an ontology. There is also generally an expectation that there be a close resemblance between the real world and the features of the model in an ontology.   [ 6 ]    \n In theory, an ontology is a \"formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation\".   [ 7 ]    An ontology renders shared  vocabulary  and  taxonomy  which models a domain with the definition of objects and/or concepts and their properties and relations.   [ 8 ]    \n Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in  artificial intelligence , the  Semantic Web ,  systems engineering ,  software engineering ,  biomedical informatics ,  library science ,  enterprise bookmarking , and  information architecture  as a form of  knowledge representation  about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an  enterprise architecture framework . \n  Careers   [  edit  ]   \n  Information scientist   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information scientist  \n An information scientist is an individual, usually with a relevant subject degree or high level of subject knowledge, providing focused information to scientific and technical research staff in industry, a role quite distinct from and complementary to that of a librarian. The title also applies to an individual carrying out research in information science. \n  Information professional   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information professional  \n An information professional is an individual who preserves, organizes, and disseminates information. Information professionals are skilled in the organization and retrieval of recorded knowledge. Traditionally, their work has been with print materials, but these skills are being increasingly used with electronic, visual, audio, and digital materials. Information professionals work in a variety of public, private, non-profit, and academic institutions. \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  Information history  \n  Early beginnings   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , a German polymath who wrote primarily in Latin and French. His fields of study were Metaphysics, Mathematics, Theodicy. \n \n \n Information science, in studying the collection,  classification , manipulation, storage,  retrieval  and dissemination of  information  has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis has been carried out by scholars at least as early as the time of the  Abyssinian Empire  with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives.   [ 9 ]    Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the  history of science , beginning with publication of the first issues of   Philosophical Transactions ,  generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London). \n The institutionalization of science occurred throughout the 18th Century. In 1731,  Benjamin Franklin  established the  Library Company of Philadelphia , the first library owned by a group of public citizens, which quickly expanded beyond the realm of books and became a center of scientific experiment, and which hosted public exhibitions of scientific experiments.   [ 10 ]    Benjamin Franklin invested a town in Massachusetts with a collection of books that the town voted to make available to all free of charge, forming the first Public Library.   [ 11 ]    Academie de Chirurgia ( Paris ) published  Memoires pour les Chirurgiens , generally considered to be the first medical journal, in 1736. The  American Philosophical Society , patterned on the  Royal Society  ( London ), was founded in Philadelphia in 1743. As numerous other scientific journals and societies were founded,  Alois Senefelder  developed the concept of lithography for use in mass printing work in  Germany  in 1796. \n  19th century   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Joseph Marie Jacquard  \n \n \n By the 19th Century the first signs of information science emerged as separate and distinct from other sciences and social sciences but in conjunction with communication and computation. In 1801,  Joseph Marie Jacquard  invented a punched card system to control operations of the cloth weaving loom in France. It was the first use of \"memory storage of patterns\" system.   [ 12 ]    As chemistry journals emerged throughout the 1820s and 1830s,   [ 13 ]     Charles Babbage  developed his \"difference engine,\" the first step towards the modern computer, in 1822 and his \"analytical engine\u201d by 1834. By 1843  Richard Hoe  developed the rotary press, and in 1844  Samuel Morse  sent the first public telegraph message. By 1848 William F. Poole begins the  Index to Periodical Literature,  the first general periodical literature index in the US. \n In 1854  George Boole  published  An Investigation into Laws of Thought...,  which lays the foundations for  Boolean algebra , which is later used in  information retrieval .   [ 14 ]    In 1860 a congress was held at Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule to discuss the feasibility of establishing a systematic and rational nomenclature for chemistry. The congress did not reach any conclusive results, but several key participants returned home with  Stanislao Cannizzaro 's outline (1858), which ultimately convinces them of the validity of his scheme for calculating atomic weights.   [ 15 ]    \n By 1865, the  Smithsonian Institution  began a catalog of current scientific papers, which became the   International Catalogue of Scientific Papers   in 1902.   [ 16 ]    The following year the Royal Society began publication of its  Catalogue of Papers  in London. In 1868, Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden, and S. W. Soule produced the  first practical typewriter . By 1872 Lord Kelvin devised an analogue computer to predict the tides, and by 1875  Frank Stephen Baldwin  was granted the first US patent for a practical calculating machine that performs four arithmetic functions.   [ 13 ]     Alexander Graham Bell  and  Thomas Edison  invented the telephone and phonograph in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and the  American Library Association  was founded in Philadelphia. In 1879  Index Medicus  was first issued by the Library of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army, with  John Shaw Billings  as librarian, and later the library issues  Index Catalogue,  which achieved an international reputation as the most complete catalog of medical literature.   [ 17 ]    \n  European documentation   [  edit  ]   \n The discipline of   documentation science  , which marks the earliest theoretical foundations of modern information science, emerged in the late part of the 19th Century in Europe together with several more scientific indexes whose purpose was to organize scholarly literature. Many information science historians cite  Paul Otlet  and  Henri La Fontaine  as the fathers of information science with the founding of the International Institute of Bibliography (IIB) in 1895.   [ 18 ]    A second generation of European Documentalists emerged after the  Second World War , most notably  Suzanne Briet . However, \"information science\" as a term is not popularly used in academia until sometime in the latter part of the 20th Century.   [ 19 ]    \n Documentalists emphasized the utilitarian integration of technology and technique toward specific social goals. According to Ronald Day, \"As an organized system of techniques and technologies, documentation was understood as a player in the historical development of global organization in modernity \u2013 indeed, a major player inasmuch as that organization was dependent on the organization and transmission of information.\"   [ 20 ]    Otlet and Lafontaine (who won the  Nobel Prize  in 1913) not only envisioned later technical innovations but also projected a global vision for information and  information technologies  that speaks directly to postwar visions of a global \"information society.\" Otlet and Lafontaine established numerous organizations dedicated to standardization, bibliography, international associations, and consequently, international cooperation. These organizations were fundamental for ensuring international production in commerce, information, communication and modern economic development, and they later found their global form in such institutions as the  League of Nations  and the  United Nations . Otlet designed the  Universal Decimal Classification , based on  Melville Dewey \u2019s decimal classification system.   [ 21 ]    \n Although he lived decades before computers and networks emerged, what he discussed prefigured what ultimately became the  World Wide Web . His vision of a great network of  knowledge  focused on  documents  and included the notions of  hyperlinks ,  search engines , remote access, and  social networks . \n Otlet not only imagined that all the world's knowledge should be interlinked and made available remotely to anyone, but he also proceeded to build a structured document collection. This collection involved standardized paper sheets and cards filed in custom-designed cabinets according to a hierarchical index (which culled information worldwide from diverse sources) and a commercial information retrieval service (which answered written requests by copying relevant information from index cards). Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.   [ 21 ]    By 1937 documentation had formally been institutionalized, as evidenced by the founding of the American Documentation Institute (ADI), later called the  American Society for Information Science and Technology . \n  Transition to modern information science   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Vannevar Bush , a famous information scientist, ca. 1940\u20131944 \n \n \n With the 1950s came increasing awareness of the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, as well as other professional programs, such as  law  and  medicine  in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as  Grateful Med  at the  National Library of Medicine , and user-oriented services such as  Dialog  and  Compuserve , were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous  special interest groups  to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.   [ 22 ]    \n  Research vectors and applications   [  edit  ]   \n The following areas are some of those that information science investigates and develops. \n  Information access   [  edit  ]   \n Information access is an area of research at the intersection of  Informatics , Information Science,  Information Security ,  Language Technology ,  Computer Science , and  Library Science . The objectives of information access research are to automate the processing of large and unwieldy amounts of information and to simplify users' access to it. Applicable technologies include  information retrieval ,  text mining ,  machine translation , and  text categorisation . In discussion, information access is often defined as concerning the insurance of free and closed access to information and is brought up in discussions on  copyright ,  patent law , and  public domain . \n  Information architecture   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information architecture  \n Information architecture (IA) is the art and science of organizing and labelling  websites ,  intranets ,  online communities  and software to support usability.   [ 23 ]    It is an emerging discipline and  community of practice  focused on bringing together principles of  design  and  architecture  to the  digital landscape .   [ 24 ]    Typically it involves a  model  or  concept  of  information  which is used and applied to activities that require explicit details of complex  information systems . These activities include  library  systems and  database  development. \n  Information management   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information management  \n Information management (IM) is the collection and management of information from one or more sources and the distribution of that information to one or more audiences. This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the structure, processing and delivery of information. Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files, file maintenance, and the life cycle management of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of information technology starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light, and also began to include the field of data maintenance. \n  Information retrieval   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information retrieval  \n Information retrieval (IR) is the area of study concerned with searching for documents, for  information  within documents, and for  metadata  about documents, as well as that of searching  structured storage ,  relational databases , and the  World Wide Web . Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called \" information overload \". Many universities and  public libraries  use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents.  Web search engines  are the most visible  IR applications . \n An information retrieval process begins when a user enters a  query  into the system. Queries are formal statements of  information needs , for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of  relevancy . \n An object is an entity that is represented by information in a  database . User queries are matched against the database information. Depending on the  application  the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images,   [ 25 ]    audio,   [ 26 ]     mind maps    [ 27 ]    or videos. Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or metadata. \n Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.   [ 28 ]    \n  Information seeking   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information seeking  \n Information seeking is the process or activity of attempting to obtain information in both human and technological contexts. Information seeking is related to, but different from, information retrieval (IR). \n Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians,   [ 29 ]    academics,   [ 30 ]    medical professionals,   [ 31 ]    engineers   [ 32 ]    and lawyers   [ 33 ]    (among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to \"prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking\" (1996, p.\u00a0188). The model has been adapted by Wilkinson (2001) who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers. \n  Information society   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information society  \n An information society is a  society  where the creation, distribution, diffusion, uses, integration and manipulation of  information  is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. The aim of an information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally, through using  IT  in a creative and productive way. The  knowledge economy  is its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called  digital citizens . \n Basically, an information society is the means of getting information from one place to another (Wark, 1997, p.\u00a022). As technology has become more advanced over time so too has the way we have adapted in sharing this information with each other. \n Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology. \n  Knowledge representation and reasoning   [  edit  ]   \n Knowledge representation (KR) is an area of  artificial intelligence  research aimed at representing knowledge in symbols to facilitate  inferencing  from those  knowledge  elements, creating new elements of knowledge. The KR can be made to be independent of the underlying knowledge model or knowledge base system (KBS) such as a  semantic network .   [ 34 ]    \n Knowledge Representation (KR) research involves analysis of how to reason accurately and effectively and how best to use a set of symbols to represent a set of facts within a knowledge domain. A symbol vocabulary and a system of logic are combined to enable  inferences  about elements in the KR to create new KR sentences. Logic is used to supply formal  semantics  of how reasoning functions should be applied to the symbols in the KR system. Logic is also used to define how operators can process and reshape the knowledge. Examples of operators and operations include, negation, conjunction, adverbs, adjectives, quantifiers and modal operators. The logic is interpretation theory. These elements\u2014symbols, operators, and interpretation theory\u2014are what give sequences of symbols meaning within a KR. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n     \n  Information science portal  \n \n \n     \n  University portal  \n \n \n \n \n  Outline of information science  \n  Outline of information technology  \n  Outline of library science  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^     Stock, W.G., &amp; Stock, M.

If the interview is non-structured, the researcher leaves it to the interviewee (also referred to as the respondent or the informant) to guide the conversation. \n  Life history  \u2013 study of the personal life of a person. Through a series of interviews, the researcher can probe into the decisive moments in their life or the various influences on their life. \n  Longitudinal study  \u2013 extensive examination of a specific group over a long period of time. \n  Observation  \u2013 using data from the senses, one records information about a social phenomenon or behavior. Qualitative research relies heavily on observation, although it is in a highly disciplined form. \n  Participant observation  \u2013 involves researchers going into the field (usually a community), living with the people for some time, and participating in their activities in order to know and feel their culture. \n \n  General information science concepts   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Academic publishing  (including  peer review  and  open access ) \n  Bibliometrics  \n  Data modeling  \n  Document management  and  Document Engineering  \n  Engineered information  \n  Groupware  \n  Human-computer interaction  (HCI) \n  Information access  \n  Information architecture  \n  Information ethics  \n  Information literacy  \n  Information management  \n  Information retrieval  (IR) \n  Information seeking \n \n  Information seeking behavior \n \n  Browsing  \n \n \n \n \n  Information society  \n  Information systems  \n  Intellectual property  (IP) \n  Knowledge engineering  \n  Knowledge management \n \n  Knowledge transfer  \n \n \n  Knowledge organization  \n  Memory institutions  \n  Ontology  \n  Personal information management  (PIM) \n  Philosophy of information  \n  Scholarly communication  \n  Scientific communication  \n  Science and technology studies  \n  Semantic Web  \n  Usability engineering \n \n  Human factors  \n \n \n  User-centered design \n \n  Design philosophy  \n \n \n \n  Related disciplines   [  edit  ]   \n There are many fields which claim to be \"sciences\" or \"disciplines\" which are difficult to distinguish from each other and from information science.

Information access covers many issues including  copyright ,  open source ,  privacy , and  security . \n Provision was made in  copyright  and  patent law  for information in the  public domain . However the extent of the public domain has been under attack in recent years, as database vendors expand the copyright and contract laws to eliminate concepts such as  fair use . UCITA, the  Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act  has been defeated in most jurisdictions, but restrictions on the public domain still exist in more recent laws such as the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act  (DMCA). \n  Librarians  have always advocated free and open access to government information. Groups such as the  American Library Association , the  American Association of Law Libraries ,  Ralph Nader 's  Taxpayers Assets Project  have advocated for free access to  legal information . The  vendor neutral citation  movement in the  legal  field is working to ensure that courts will accept  citations  from cases on the web which do not have the traditional (copyrighted) page numbers from the  West Publishing  company. There is a worldwide  Free Access to Law Movement  which advocates free access to legal information. The Wired Magazine Article  Who Owns The Law  is a good introduction to the access to legal information issue. \n Acts following the  September 11 attacks , such as the  Patriot Act , in the interest of  security  has led to restrictions on access to certain types of information as well as an increased government attempts at surveillance of individual's  private  information, such as their library records. \n  Links to free software   [  edit  ]   \n Free software takes the approaches of openly accessible information and applies them to software code. Based on the tenets of open information practices,  free and open source software  takes a freedom based approach to software development and maintenance. The free software movement has impacted areas such as  software  and free access to  scholarly journals .  Lawrence Lessig , himself a board member of  Free Software Foundation  advocates free software and argues that computer code can regulate conduct in much the same way that  legal codes  do. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Freedom of information legislation  \n  Action For Economic Reforms  (On access to information in the Philippines) \n  Sinenjongo High School  \n \n  External links   [  edit  ]   \n \n  CRS Report - Access to Government Information in the United States  \n  Access to Information in the Philippines  \n  Information Access Alliance  \n  ALA- Access to Electronic Information, Services, and Networks  \n  Issues in Access to Information: A Bibliography  \n  The Information Society - The way to equitable globalisation and development?

[ 4 ]    [   page\u00a0needed   ]  \n \n  Debate   [  edit  ]   \n The difficulty in establishing a common definition for \"information architecture\" arises partly from the term's existence in multiple fields. In the field of  systems design , for example, information architecture is a component of  enterprise architecture  that deals with the information component when describing the structure of an enterprise. \n While the definition of information architecture is relatively well-established in the field of systems design, it is much more debatable within the context of online information systems (i.e., websites). Andrew Dillon refers to the latter as the \"big IA-little IA debate\".   [ 5 ]    In the little IA view, information architecture is essentially the application of information science to web design which considers, for example, issues of classification and information retrieval. In the big IA view, information architecture involves more than just the organization of a website; it also factors in  user experience , thereby considering  usability  issues of  information design . \n  The role of IA   [  edit  ]   \n  Information architecture  is a specialized skill set that interprets information and expresses distinctions between signs and systems of signs. More concretely, it involves the categorization of information into a coherent structure, preferably one that the intended audience can understand quickly, if not inherently, and then easily retrieve the information for which they are searching   [ 4 ]    [   page\u00a0needed   ] . The organization structure is usually  hierarchical , but can have other structures, such as concentric or even chaotic   [ 4 ]    [   page\u00a0needed   ] . Typically this is required in activities such as  library  systems,  content management systems ,  web development ,  user interactions ,  database  development,  computer programming ,  technical writing ,  enterprise architecture , and critical system  software design . Information architecture originates, to some degree, in the  library sciences . Many schools with library and information science departments teach information architecture.   [ 6 ]    \n In the context of information systems design, information architecture refers to the analysis and design of the data stored by information systems, concentrating on entities, their attributes, and their interrelationships. It refers to the modeling of data for an individual database and to the corporate data models that an enterprise uses to coordinate the definition of data in several (perhaps scores or hundreds) distinct databases. The \" canonical data model \" is applied to integration technologies as a definition for specific data passed between the systems of an enterprise. At a higher level of abstraction, it may also refer to the definition of data stores. \n  Information architect   [  edit  ]   \n  Richard Saul Wurman  says of the term information architect \"used in the words architect of foreign policy. I mean architect as in the creating of systemic, structural, and orderly principles to make something work \u2014 the thoughtful making of either artifact, or idea, or policy that informs because it is clear.\"   [ 2 ]    [   page\u00a0needed   ]  \n  Notable people in information architecture   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Jesse James Garrett  \n  Adam Greenfield  \n  Andrew Hinton  \n  Dan Klyn  \n  Peter Morville  \n  Eric Reiss  \n  Andrea Resmini  \n  Lou Rosenfeld  \n  Christina Wodtke  \n  Richard Saul Wurman  \n  David Weinberger  \n \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Application Architecture  \n  Business analyst  \n  Card sorting  \n  Chief Experience Officer  (CXO) \n  Controlled vocabulary  \n  Data architecture  \n  Data management  \n  Data Presentation Architecture  \n  Digital Humanities  \n  Enterprise architecture  \n  Enterprise information security architecture  \n  Faceted classification  \n  Human factors  \n  Informatics  \n  Information design  \n  Information system  \n  Interaction design  \n  Knowledge organization  \n  Ontology  \n  Process architecture  \n  Semantic Web  \n  Sitemap  \n  Social Information Architecture  \n  Taxonomy  \n  Tree testing  \n  User experience design  \n  Knowledge visualization  \n  Wayfinding  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n  ^     a         b          What is IA?

This sometimes involves those who have a stake in, or a right to that information. Management means the organization of and control over the planning, structure and organisation, controlling, processing, evaluating and reporting of information activities in order to meet client objectives and to enable corporate functions in the delivery of information. \n Throughout the 1970s this was largely limited to files, file maintenance, and the  life cycle management  of paper-based files, other media and records. With the proliferation of  information technology  starting in the 1970s, the job of information management took on a new light, and also began to include the field of  data maintenance . No longer was information management a simple job that could be performed by almost anyone. An understanding of the technology involved, and the theory behind it became necessary. As information storage shifted to electronic means, this became more and more difficult. By the late 1990s when information was regularly disseminated across computer networks and by other electronic means, network managers, in a sense, became information managers. Those individuals found themselves tasked with increasingly complex tasks, hardware and software. With the latest tools available, information management has become a powerful resource and a large expense, as well as risk, for many organizations. \n In short, information management entails organizing, retrieving, acquiring, securing and maintaining information. It is closely related to and overlapping with the practice of data management. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Information management concepts  \n \n   1.1   Reduction of information processing needs  \n \n   1.1.1   Environmental management   \n   1.1.2   Creation of slack resources   \n   1.1.3   Creation of self-contained tasks   \n \n \n   1.2   Increasing the organizational information processing capacity  \n \n   1.2.1   Creation of lateral relations   \n   1.2.2   Investment in vertical information systems   \n \n \n \n \n   2   See also   \n   3   References   \n   4   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Information management concepts   [  edit  ]   \n Following the behavioral science theory of management, mainly developed at  Carnegie Mellon University  and prominently represented by Barnard,  Richard M. Cyert ,  March  and  Simon , most of what goes on in service organizations is actually decision making and information processes. The crucial factor in the information and decision process analysis is thus individuals\u2019 limited ability to process information and to make decisions under these limitations. \n According to March and Simon,   [ 1 ]    organizations have to be considered as cooperative systems with a high level of  information processing  and a vast need for decision making at various levels. They also claimed that there are factors that would prevent individuals from acting strictly rationally, in opposite to what has been proposed and advocated by classic theorists. \n Instead of using the model of the  economic man , as advocated in classic theory, they proposed the administrative man as an alternative based on their argumentation about the cognitive limits of rationality. \n While the theories developed at Carnegie Mellon clearly filled some theoretical gaps in the discipline, March and Simon   [ 1 ]    did not propose a certain organizational form that they considered especially feasible for coping with cognitive limitations and  bounded rationality  of decision-makers. Through their own argumentation against normative decision-making models, i.e., models that prescribe people how they ought to choose, they also abandoned the idea of an ideal organizational form. \n In addition to the factors mentioned by March and Simon, there are two other considerable aspects, which stem from environmental and organizational dynamics. Firstly, it is not possible to access, collect and evaluate all environmental information being relevant for taking a certain decision at a reasonable price, i.e., time and effort.   [ 2 ]    In other words, following a national economic framework, the  transaction cost  associated with the information process is too high. Secondly, established organizational rules and procedures can prevent the taking of the most appropriate decision, i.e., that a sub-optimum solution is chosen in accordance to organizational rank structure or institutional rules, guidelines and procedures,   [ 3 ]      [ 4 ]    an issue that also has been brought forward as a major critique against the principles of bureaucratic organizations.   [ 5 ]    \n According to the Carnegie Mellon School and its followers, information management, i.e., the organization's ability to process information, is at the core of organizational and managerial competencies. Consequently, strategies for organization design must be aiming at improved information processing capability. Jay Galbraith   [ 6 ]    has identified five main organization design strategies within two categories \u2013 increased information processing capacity and reduced need for information processing. \n \n  Reduction of information processing needs \n \n  Environmental management  \n  Creation of slack resources  \n  Creation of self-contained tasks  \n \n \n  Increasing the organizational information processing capacity \n \n  Creation of lateral relations  \n  Investment in vertical information systems  \n \n \n \n  Reduction of information processing needs   [  edit  ]   \n  Environmental management   [  edit  ]   \n Administrative functions that develop, implement, and monitor the  environmental policy  of an organization.   [ 7 ]    \n An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a framework that helps a company achieve its environmental goals through consistent control of its operations. The assumption is that this increased control will improve the environmental performance of the company. The EMS itself does not dictate a level of environmental performance that must be achieved; each company's EMS is tailored to the company's business and goals. Basic Elements of an EMS: \n Reviewing the company's environmental goals Analyzing its environmental impacts and legal requirements Setting environmental objectives and targets to reduce environmental impacts and comply with legal requirements Establishing programs to meet these objectives and targets Monitoring and measuring progress in achieving the objectives Ensuring employees' environmental awareness and competence Reviewing progress of the EMS and making improvements   [ 8 ]    \n Instead of adapting to changing environmental circumstances, the organization can seek to modify its environment. Vertical and horizontal collaboration, i.e. cooperation or integration with other organizations in the industry value system are typical means of reducing uncertainty. An example of reducing uncertainty in relation to the prior or demanding stage of the industry system is the concept of Supplier-Retailer collaboration or Efficient Customer Response. \n  Creation of slack resources   [  edit  ]   \n In order to reduce exceptions, performance levels can be reduced, thus decreasing the  information load  on the hierarchy. These additional slack resources, required to reduce  information processing , represent an additional cost to the organization. The choice of this method depends on the alternative costs of other strategies. \n  Creation of self-contained tasks   [  edit  ]   \n Achieving a conceptual closure of tasks is another way of reducing  information processing . In this case, the task-performing unit has all the resources required to perform the task. This approach is concerned with task (de-)composition and interaction between different organizational units, i.e. organizational and information interfaces. \n  Increasing the organizational information processing capacity   [  edit  ]   \n  Creation of lateral relations   [  edit  ]   \n In this case, lateral decision processes are established that cut across functional organizational units. The aim is to apply a system of decision subsidiarity, i.e. to move decision power to the process, instead of moving information from the process into the hierarchy for  decision-making . \n  Investment in vertical information systems   [  edit  ]   \n Instead of processing information through the existing hierarchical channels, the organization can establish vertical information systems. In this case, the information flow for a specific task (or set of tasks) is routed in accordance to the applied  business logic , rather than the hierarchical organization. \n Following the lateral relations concept, it also becomes possible to employ an organizational form that is different from the simple hierarchical information. The Matrix organization is aiming at bringing together the functional and product departmental bases and achieving a balance in information processing and decision making between the vertical (hierarchical) and the horizontal (product or project) structure. The creation of a matrix organization can also be considered as management's response to a persistent or permanent demand for adaptation to environmental dynamics, instead of the response to episodic demands. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n \n  Controlled vocabulary  \n  Data flow diagram  \n  Data maintenance  \n  Data management  \n   Data Smog   (book) \n  Digital Continuity  \n  Document management  \n  Documentation Standards  \n  Enterprise bookmarking  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  Content management  \n   Glut: Mastering Information Through The Ages   (book) \n  Information continuum  \n  Information governance  \n  Knowledge Balance Sheet  \n  Knowledge management  \n  Operations research  \n  Personal information management  \n  Personal knowledge management  \n  Systems analysis  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n  ^     a         b       March, James G. and Simon, Herbert A.

Information seeking is related to, but different from,  information retrieval  (IR). \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Information retrieval   \n   2   In different contexts   \n   3   Theories of information-seeking behavior   \n   4   Wilson's nested model of conceptual areas   \n   5   See also   \n   6   References   \n   7   References   \n \n \n  \n  Information retrieval   [  edit  ]   \n Traditionally, IR tools have been designed for IR professionals to enable them to effectively and efficiently retrieve information from a source. It is assumed that the information exists in the source and that a well-formed query will retrieve it (and nothing else). It has been argued that  laypersons'  information seeking on the internet is very different from information retrieval as performed within the IR discourse. Yet, internet search engines are built on IR principles. Since the late 1990s a body of research on how casual users interact with internet search engines has been forming, but the topic is far from fully understood. IR can be said to be technology-oriented, focusing on  algorithms  and issues such as  precision  and  recall . Information seeking may be understood as a more human-oriented and open-ended process than information retrieval. In information seeking, one does not know whether there exists an answer to one's query, so the process of seeking may provide the learning required to satisfy one's  information need . \n  In different contexts   [  edit  ]   \n Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians,   [ 1 ]    academics,   [ 2 ]    medical professionals,   [ 3 ]    engineers   [ 4 ]    and lawyers   [ 5 ]    (among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to \"prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking\" (1996, p.\u00a0188). The model has been adapted by Wilkinson (2001) who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers. \n  Theories of information-seeking behavior   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Information seeking behavior  \n A variety of theories of information behavior \u2013 e.g.  Zipf 's Principle of Least Effort,  Brenda Dervin 's Sense Making,  Elfreda Chatman 's Life in the Round \u2013 seek to understand the processes that surround information seeking. \n A review of the literature on information seeking behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non-linear (Foster, 2005; Kuhlthau 2006). People experience the information search process as an interplay of thoughts, feelings and actions ( Kuhlthau, 2006 ). Donald O. Case (2007) also wrote a good book that is a review of the literature. \n Information seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question-asking, to include strategies such as candidate answers. \n Robinson\u2019s (2010)   [ 6 ]    research suggests that when seeking information at work, people rely on both other people and information repositories (e.g., documents and databases), and spend similar amounts of time consulting each (7.8% and 6.4% of work time, respectively; 14.2% in total). However, the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source. When consulting other people, people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source, similar time understanding the information, and more time problem solving and decision making, than when consulting information repositories. Furthermore, the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively (i.e., information that they have not requested) than actively (i.e., information that they have requested), and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information. \n  Wilson's nested model of conceptual areas   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nWilson's Nested Model of Conceptual Areas \n \n \n The concepts of information seeking, information retrieval, and information behaviour are objects of investigation of  information science . Within this scientific discipline a variety of studies has been undertaken analyzing the interaction of an individual with  information sources  in case of a specific  information need , task, and context. The research models developed in these studies vary in their level of scope. Wilson (1999) therefore developed a nested model of conceptual areas, which visualizes the interrelation of the here mentioned central concepts. \n Wilson defines models of information behavior to be \"statements, often in the form of diagrams, that attempt to describe an information-seeking activity, the causes and consequences of that activity, or the relationships among stages in information-seeking behaviour\" (1999: 250). \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Browse  \n  Collaborative information seeking  \n  FBI Seeking Information \u2013 War on Terrorism list  \n  Information foraging  \n  Onboarding  \n  Social information seeking  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^     Brown, C.

The aim of the information society is to gain competitive advantage internationally, through using  information technology  (IT) in a creative and productive way. The  knowledge economy  is its economic counterpart, whereby wealth is created through the economic exploitation of understanding. People who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called  digital citizens . This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.   [ 1 ]    \n The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.   [ 2 ]    Information society is seen as the successor to  industrial society . Closely related concepts are the  post-industrial society  ( Daniel Bell ),  post-fordism ,  post-modern  society, knowledge society, telematic society,  Information Revolution ,  liquid modernity , and  network society  ( Manuel Castells ). \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Definition   \n   2   The growth of information in society   \n   3   Development of the information society model   \n   4   Second and third nature   \n   5   Sociological uses   \n   6   Related terms   \n   7   Intellectual property considerations   \n   8   See also   \n   9   References   \n   10   Further reading   \n   11   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Definition   [  edit  ]   \n There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the  internet , and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. \n In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information Society in the  Tunis Commitment  and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase. \n Some people, such as  Antonio Negri , characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function? For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It  is  now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest\u2014even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development. \n Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the  Japanese  society) as an information society because we think of it as such as letters.   [ 3 ]    \n  The growth of information in society   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n  Internet users per 100 inhabitants  \n Source:  International Telecommunications Union .

It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed)  exabytes  in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB  CD-ROM  per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed)  exabytes  in 2007.   [ 6 ]    This is the informational equivalent of 60  CD-ROM  per person in 2007   [ 7 ]    and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world\u2019s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way  broadcast  networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.   [ 6 ]    The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way  telecommunication  networks was 281  petabytes  of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471  petabytes  in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed)  exabytes  in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed)  exabytes  in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.   [ 7 ]    The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 \u00d7 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.   [ 6 ]    \n James Beniger describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: \u201cThe need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)\u201d (p.\u00a0174) \u201cEven with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.\u201d(p.\u00a0175)    [ 1 ]    \n  Development of the information society model   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nClark's Sector Model \n \n \n One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist  Fritz Machlup . In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study  The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States  in 1962. This book was widely regarded    [ 8 ]    and was eventually translated into  Russian  and  Japanese . The Japanese have also studied the information society (or  johoka shakai ,  \u60c5\u5831\u5316\u793e\u4f1a ). \n The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or  information economy ,  post-industrial society ,  postmodern  society,  network society , the  information revolution , informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades. \n Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the  knowledge industry . He distinguished five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries. [   citation needed   ]  \n  Peter Drucker  has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.   [ 9 ]     Marc Porat  distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.   [ 10 ]    Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The  OECD  has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.   [ 11 ]    \n For  Daniel Bell  the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. \"A post-industrial society is based on services. (\u2026) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (\u2026) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods\".   [ 12 ]    \n  Alain Touraine  already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. \"The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (\u2026) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities\" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning. \n  Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard    [ 13 ]    has argued that \"knowledge has become the principle [  sic  ] force of production over the last few decades\". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society. \n Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter.  Radovan Richta  (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production. \n  Nico Stehr  (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. \"Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge\" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a). \n Also  Alvin Toffler  argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: \"In a Third Wave economy, the central resource \u2013 a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values \u2013 is actionable knowledge\" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994). \n At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the  network society  gained importance in information society theory. For  Manuel Castells , network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). \"One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'\" (Castells 2000: 21). \"As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture\" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.  Jan Van Dijk  (2006) defines the network society as a \"social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)\" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society.  Darin Barney  uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: \"The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated \u2013 almost exclusively digital \u2013 technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (\u2026) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations\".   [ 14 ]    \n The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. \"If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new\" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as  Frank Webster  argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (Webster 2002b: 267). These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and  cultural capital . They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century,  corporate capitalism  in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (Webster 2006). \n For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like: \n \n transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ( Christian Fuchs  2008, 2007): \"Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society.\" (Fuchs 2008: 110+119). \n \n \n digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also  Peter Glotz ):   [ 15 ]    \"networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before\" (Schiller 2000: xiv) \n virtual capitalism: the \"combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital\" (Dawson/ John Bellamy Foster  1998: 63sq), \n high-tech capitalism   [ 16 ]    or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) \u2013 to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy. \n \n Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ( Manuel Castells  2000,  Christian Fuchs  2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by \"information generation, processing, and transmission\" that have become \"the fundamental sources of productivity and power\" (Castells 2000: 21). The \"most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism\" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500).  Nicholas Garnham    [ 17 ]    is critical of Castells and argues that the latter\u2019s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new \"mode of development\" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society. \n  Antonio Negri  and  Michael Hardt  argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour \"that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response\" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and affective labour that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.). \n Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ( David Harvey  1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause structural unemployment, rising poverty, social exclusion, the deregulation of the welfare state and of labour rights, the lowering of wages, welfare, etc. \n Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it. [   citation needed   ]  Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology. \n  Second and third nature   [  edit  ]   \n As mentioned earlier an information society is the means of getting information from one place to another (Wark, 1997, p.\u00a022). As technology has become more advanced over time so too has the way we have adapted in sharing this information with each other. \n \"Second nature\" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture (Wark, 1997, p.\u00a023). They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted (Wark, 1997, p.\u00a021). \n However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move (Wark, 1997, p.\u00a024). From here, something called \"third nature\" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to \u2018speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where (Wark, 1997, p.25). It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object (Wark, 1997, p.26). As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society. \n Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction (Wark, 1997, p.28). \n  Sociological uses   [  edit  ]   \n In  sociology ,   informational society   refers to a  post-modern  type of society. Theoreticians like  Ulrich Beck ,  Anthony Giddens  and  Manuel Castells  argue that since the 1970s a transformation from  industrial society  to informational society has happened on a global scale.   [ 18 ]    \n As  steam power  was the technology standing behind industrial society, so  information technology  is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century. \n In the book   Future Shock  ,  Alvin Toffler  used the phrase  super-industrial society  to describe this type of society. Other writers and thinkers have used terms like \" post-industrial society \" and \"post-modern industrial society\" with a similar meaning. \n  Related terms   [  edit  ]   \n A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order. The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society. The  Information Age  is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the  knowledge economy , rather than an emerging economic order. The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded. The  computer revolution , and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The  Information Revolution  relates with the well known terms  agricultural revolution  and  industrial revolution . \n The  information economy  and the  knowledge economy  emphasize the  content  or  intellectual property  that is being traded through an information market or  knowledge market , respectively.  Electronic commerce  and  electronic business  emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the  Internet  and  World-Wide Web . The  digital economy  focuses on trading bits in  cyberspace  rather than atoms in physical space. The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units.  Social networking  refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales. The  internet economy  focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet. Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates  Knowledge management , within a  Knowledge organization , that trades in a  Knowledge market . In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. \n Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing. Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society. Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged. \n  Intellectual property considerations   [  edit  ]   \n One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to  intellectual property . Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because  copy protection  is often easily circumvented and socially  rejected   [1]  because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute commodification of the facts and information that compose their environment. \n Responses to this concern range from the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act  in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make  copy protection  (see  DRM ) circumvention illegal, to the  free software ,  open source  and  copyleft  movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the \"freedom\" of various information products (traditionally both as in \"gratis\" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share). \n Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like \"we all do internet now\"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n  Digital transformation  \n  Digital Dark Ages  \n  Information history  \n  Information industry  \n  Information Revolution  \n  Network society  \n  Simon Buckingham  and  unorganisation  \n  The Information Society  (journal) \n  World Summit on the Information Society  (WSIS) \n \n \n \n  WSIS Stocktaking  \n  WSIS PROJECT PRIZES  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n  ^     a         b        Beniger, James R.

In this meaning, KO is about activities such as document description, indexing and classification performed in libraries, databases, archives etc. These activities are done by librarians, archivists, subject specialists as well as by computer algorithms. KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) as well as the knowledge organizing systems (KOS) used to organize documents, document representations and concepts. \n There exist different historical and theoretical approaches to and theories about organizing knowledge, which are related to different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. Each of these approaches tends to answer the question: \u201cWhat is knowledge organization?\u201d differently. Library Information Service professionals have often concentrated on applying new technology and standards, and may not have seen their work as involving interpretation and analysis of meaning. That is why library classification has been  criticized for a lack of substantive intellectual content.  [   citation needed   ]  \n Traditional human-based activities are increasingly challenged by computer-based retrieval techniques. It is appropriate to investigate the relative contributions of different approaches; the current challenges make it imperative to reconsider this understanding. \n The leading journal in this field is  Knowledge Organization    [ 1 ]    published by the  International Society for Knowledge Organization  (ISKO). See also \"Lifeboat for Knowledge Organization\".   [ 2 ]    \n A broad introduction to knowledge organization can be found in Hoetzlein (2007).

His interest was not to find an optimal system to support users of libraries, but rather to find an efficient way to manage library collections. He was interested in developing a system which could be used in many libraries, a standardized way to manage library collections. \n An important characteristic in Henry Bliss' (and many contemporary thinkers of KO) was that the sciences tend to reflect the order of Nature and that library classification should reflect the order of knowledge as uncovered by science: \n Natural order --&gt; Scientific Classification --&gt; Library classification (KO) \n The implication is that librarians, in order to classify books, should know about scientific developments. This should also be reflected in their education: \u201cAgain from the standpoint of the higher education of librarians, the teaching of systems of classification . . . would be perhaps better conducted by including courses in the systematic encyclopedia and methodology of all the sciences, that is to say, outlines which try to summarize the most recent results in the relation to one another in which they are now studied together. . . .\u201d ( Ernest Cushing Richardson , quoted from Bliss, 1935, p.\u00a02). \n Among the other principles, which may be attributed to the traditional approach to KO are: \n \n Principle of controlled vocabulary \n Cutter\u2019s rule about specificity \n Hulme\u2019s principle of literary warrant (1911) \n Principle of organizing from the general to the specific \n \n Today, after more than 100 years of research and development in LIS, the \u201ctraditional\u201d approach still has a strong position in KO and in many ways its principles still dominate. \n  Facet analytic approaches   [  edit  ]   \n The date of the foundation of this approach may be chosen as the publication of  S. R. Ranganathan \u2019s  Colon Classification  in 1933. The approach has been further developed by, in particular, the British Classification Research Group. In many ways this approach has dominated what might be termed \u201cmodern classification theory.\u201d \n The best way to explain this approach is probably to explain its analytico-synthetic methodology. The meaning of the term \u201canalysis\u201d is: Breaking down each subject into its basic concepts. The meaning of the term synthesis is: Combining the relevant units and concepts to describe the subject matter of the information package in hand. \n Given subjects (as they appear in, for example, book titles) are first analyzed into a few common categories, which are termed \u201cfacets\u201d. Ranganathan proposed his PMEST formula: Personality, Matter, Energy, Space and Time: \n \n Personality is the distinguishing characteristic of a subject \n Matter is the physical material of which a subject may be composed \n Energy is any action that occurs with respect to the subject \n Space is the geographic component of the location of a subject. \n Time is the period associated with a subject. \n \n  The information retrieval tradition (IR)   [  edit  ]   \n Important in the IR-tradition have been, among others, the Cranfield experiments, which were founded in the 1950s, and the TREC experiments (Text Retrieval Conferences) starting in 1992. It was the Cranfield experiments, which introduced the famous measures \u201crecall\u201d and \u201cprecision\u201d as evaluation criteria for systems efficiency. The Cranfield experiments found that classification systems like UDC and facet-analytic systems were less efficient compared to free-text searches or low level indexing systems (\u201cUNITERM\u201d). The Cranfield I test found according to Ellis (1996, 3-6) the following results. \n \n UNITERM 82,0% recall \n Alphabetical subject headings 81,5% recall \n UDC 75,6% recall \n Facet classification scheme 73,8% recall \n \n Although these results have been criticized and questioned, the IR-tradition became much more influential while library classification research lost influence. The dominant trend has been to regard only statistical averages. What has largely been neglected is to ask: Are there certain kinds of questions in relation to which other kinds of representation, for example, controlled vocabularies, may improve recall and precision? \n  User-oriented and cognitive views   [  edit  ]   \n The best way to define this approach is probably by method: Systems based upon user-oriented approaches must specify how the design of a system is made on the basis of empirical studies of users. \n User studies demonstrated very early that users prefer verbal search systems as opposed to systems based on classification notations. This is one example of a principle derived from empirical studies of users. Adherents of classification notations may, of course, still have an argument: That notations are well-defined and that users may miss important information by not considering them. \n Folksonomies is a recent kind of KO based on users' rather than on librarians' or subject specialists' indexing. \n  Bibliometric approaches   [  edit  ]   \n These approaches are primarily based on using bibliographical references to organize networks of papers, mainly by bibliographic coupling (introduced by Kessler 1963) or co-citation analysis ( independently suggested by Marshakova 1973 and Small 1973). In recent years it has become a popular activity to construe bibliometric maps as structures of research fields. \n Two considerations are important in considering bibliometric approaches to KO: \n \n The level of indexing depth is partly determined by the number of terms assigned to each document. In citation indexing this corresponds to the number of references in a given paper. On the average, scientific papers contain 10-15 references, which provide quite a high level of depth. \n The references, which function as access points, are provided by the highest subject-expertise: The experts writing in the leading journals. This expertise is much higher than that which library catalogs or bibliographical databases typically are able to draw on. \n \n  The domain analytic approach   [  edit  ]   \n Domain analysis is a sociological-epistemological standpoint. The indexing of a given document should reflect the needs of a given group of users or a given ideal purpose. In other words, any description or representation of a given document is more or less suited to the fulfillment of certain tasks. A description is never objective or neutral, and the goal is not to standardize descriptions or make one description once and for all for different target groups. \n The development of the Danish library \u201c KVINFO \u201d may serve as an example that explains the domain-analytic point of view. \n KVINFO was founded by the librarian and writer Nynne Koch and its history goes back to 1965. Nynne Koch was employed at the Royal Library in Copenhagen in a position without influence on book selection. She was interested in women\u2019s\u2019 studies and began personally to collect printed catalog cards of books in the Royal Library, which were considered relevant for women\u2019s studies. She developed a classification system for this subject. Later she became the head of KVINFO and got a budget for buying books and journals, and still later, KVINFO became an independent library. The important theoretical point of view is that the Royal Library had an official systematic catalog of a high standard. Normally it is assumed that such a catalog is able to identify relevant books for users whatever their theoretical orientation. This example demonstrates, however, that for a specific user group (feminist scholars), an alternative way of organizing catalog cards was important. In other words: Different points of view need different systems of organization. \n DA is the only approach to KO which has seriously examined epistemological issues in the field, i.e. comparing the assumptions made in different approaches to KO and examining the questions regarding subjectivity and objectivity in KO. Subjectivity is not just about individual differences. Such differences are of minor interest because they cannot be used as guidelines for KO. What seems important are collective views shared by many users. A kind of subjectivity about many users is related to philosophical positions. In any field of knowledge different views are always at play. In arts, for example, different views of art are always present. Such views determine views on art works, writing on art works, how art works are organized in exhibitions and how writings on art are organized in libraries (see \u00d8rom 2003). In general it can be stated that different philosophical positions on any issue have implications for relevance criteria, information needs and for criteria of organizing knowledge. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Automatic document classification  \n  Document classification  \n  Knowledge organization systems  \n  Library classification  \n  Library and Information Science  \n  Personal information management  \n  Body of Knowledge  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^     Knowledge Organization.  http://www.isko.org/ko.html   \n    ^     Hj\u00f8rland, Birger (ed.).

[ 1 ]      [ 2 ]    \n Ontologies are the structural frameworks for organizing information and are used in  artificial intelligence , the  Semantic Web ,  systems engineering ,  software engineering ,  biomedical informatics ,  library science ,  enterprise bookmarking , and  information architecture  as a form of  knowledge representation  about the world or some part of it. The creation of domain ontologies is also fundamental to the definition and use of an  enterprise architecture framework . \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Overview   \n   2   History   \n   3   Components   \n   4   Types of ontologies  \n \n   4.1   Domain ontology   \n   4.2   Upper ontology   \n   4.3   Hybrid ontology   \n \n \n   5   Ontology Visualization   \n   6   Ontology engineering  \n \n   6.1   Ontology editor   \n   6.2   Ontology learning   \n \n \n   7   Ontology languages   \n   8   Examples of published ontologies   \n   9   Ontology libraries   \n   10   Examples of applications using ontology engines   \n   11   Criticisms   \n   12   See also   \n   13   References   \n   14   Further reading   \n   15   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Overview   [  edit  ]   \n The term   ontology   has its origin in  philosophy  and has been applied in many different ways. The word element   onto-   comes from the  Greek    \u1f64\u03bd , \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 , (\"being\", \"that which is\"), present participle of the verb   \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af   (\"be\"). The core meaning within  computer science  is a model for describing the world that consists of a set of types, properties, and relationship types. There is also generally an expectation that the features of the model in an ontology should closely resemble the real world.   [ 3 ]    \n What many ontologies have in common in both computer science and in philosophy is the representation of entities, ideas, and events, along with their properties and relations, according to a system of categories. In both fields, there is considerable work on problems of ontological relativity (e.g.,  Quine  and  Kripke  in philosophy,  Sowa  and  Guarino  in computer science),   [ 4 ]    and debates concerning whether a  normative  ontology is viable (e.g., debates over  foundationalism  in philosophy, and over the  Cyc  project in AI). Differences between the two are largely matters of focus. Computer scientists are more concerned with establishing fixed, controlled vocabularies, while philosophers are more concerned in first principles, such as whether there are such things as  fixed essences  or whether entities must be ontologically more primary than processes. \n Other fields make ontological assumptions that are sometimes explicitly elaborated and explored. For instance, the  definition and ontology of economics  (also sometimes called the  political economy ) is hotly debated especially in  Marxist economics    [ 5 ]    where it is a primary concern, but also in other subfields.   [ 6 ]    Such concerns intersect with those of information science when a simulation or model is intended to enable decisions in the economic realm; for example, to determine what  capital assets  are at risk and if so by how much (see  risk management ). Some claim all social sciences have explicit ontology issues because they do not have hard  falsifiability  criteria like most models in physical sciences and that indeed the lack of such widely accepted hard falsation criteria is what defines a social or soft science. [   citation needed   ]  \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n Historically, ontologies arise out of the branch of  philosophy  known as  metaphysics , which deals with the nature of reality\u00a0\u2013 of what exists. This fundamental branch is concerned with analyzing various types or modes of existence, often with special attention to the relations between  particulars  and  universals , between  intrinsic and extrinsic properties , and between  essence  and  existence . The traditional goal of ontological inquiry in particular is to divide the world \"at its joints\" to discover those fundamental categories or kinds into which the world\u2019s objects naturally fall.   [ 7 ]    \n During the second half of the 20th century, philosophers extensively debated the possible methods or approaches to building ontologies without actually  building  any very elaborate ontologies themselves. By contrast, computer scientists were building some large and robust ontologies, such as  WordNet  and  Cyc , with comparatively little debate over  how  they were built. \n Since the mid-1970s, researchers in the field of  artificial intelligence  (AI) have recognized that capturing knowledge is the key to building large and powerful AI systems. AI researchers argued that they could create new ontologies as  computational models  that enable certain kinds of  automated reasoning . In the 1980s, the AI community began to use the term  ontology  to refer to both a theory of a modeled world and a component of knowledge systems. Some researchers, drawing inspiration from philosophical ontologies, viewed computational ontology as a kind of applied philosophy.   [ 8 ]    \n In the early 1990s, the widely cited Web page and paper \"Toward Principles for the Design of Ontologies Used for Knowledge Sharing\" by  Tom Gruber    [ 9 ]    is credited with a deliberate definition of  ontology  as a technical term in  computer science . Gruber introduced the term to mean a specification of a conceptualization: \n \n An ontology is a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can formally exist for an agent or a community of agents. This definition is consistent with the usage of ontology as set of concept definitions, but more general. And it is a different sense of the word than its use in philosophy.   [ 10 ]    \n \n According to Gruber (1993): \n \n Ontologies are often equated with taxonomic hierarchies of classes, class definitions, and the subsumption relation, but ontologies need not be limited to these forms. Ontologies are also not limited to  conservative definitions \u00a0\u2014 that is, definitions in the traditional logic sense that only introduce terminology and do not add any knowledge about the world.   [ 11 ]    To specify a conceptualization, one needs to state axioms that do constrain the possible interpretations for the defined terms.   [ 1 ]    \n \n  Components   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ontology components  \n Contemporary ontologies share many structural similarities, regardless of the language in which they are expressed. As mentioned above, most ontologies describe individuals (instances), classes (concepts), attributes, and relations. In this section each of these components is discussed in turn. \n Common components of ontologies include: \n \n  Individuals:  instances or objects (the basic or \"ground level\" objects) \n   Classes :   sets , collections, concepts,  classes in programming ,  types of objects , or kinds of things \n   Attributes :  aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects (and classes) can have \n   Relations :  ways in which classes and individuals can be related to one another \n  Function terms:  complex structures formed from certain relations that can be used in place of an individual term in a statement \n  Restrictions:  formally stated descriptions of what must be true in order for some assertion to be accepted as input \n  Rules:  statements in the form of an if-then (antecedent-consequent) sentence that describe the logical inferences that can be drawn from an assertion in a particular form \n  Axioms:  assertions (including rules) in a  logical form  that together comprise the overall theory that the ontology describes in its domain of application. This definition differs from that of \"axioms\" in  generative grammar  and  formal logic . In those disciplines, axioms include only statements asserted as  a priori  knowledge. As used here, \"axioms\" also include the theory derived from axiomatic statements \n   Events :  the changing of attributes or relations \n \n Ontologies are commonly encoded using  ontology languages . \n  Types of ontologies   [  edit  ]   \n  Domain ontology   [  edit  ]   \n A domain ontology (or domain-specific ontology) models a specific domain, which represents part of the world. Particular meanings of terms applied to that domain are provided by domain ontology. For example the word   card   has many different meanings. An ontology about the domain of  poker  would model the \" playing card \" meaning of the word, while an ontology about the domain of  computer hardware  would model the \" punched card \" and \" video card \" meanings. \n Since domain ontologies represent concepts in very specific and often eclectic ways, they are often incompatible. As systems that rely on domain ontologies expand, they often need to merge domain ontologies into a more general representation. This presents a challenge to the ontology designer. Different ontologies in the same domain arise due to different languages, different intended usage of the ontologies, and different perceptions of the domain (based on cultural background, education, ideology, etc.). \n At present, merging ontologies that are not developed from a common foundation ontology is a largely manual process and therefore time-consuming and expensive. Domain ontologies that use the same foundation ontology to provide a set of basic elements with which to specify the meanings of the domain ontology elements can be merged automatically. There are studies on generalized techniques for merging ontologies,   [ 12 ]    but this area of research is still largely theoretical. \n  Upper ontology   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Upper ontology  \n An  upper ontology  (or foundation ontology) is a model of the common objects that are generally applicable across a wide range of domain ontologies. It employs a  core glossary  that contains the terms and associated object descriptions as they are used in various relevant domain sets. \n There are several standardized upper ontologies available for use, including  Dublin Core ,  GFO ,  OpenCyc / ResearchCyc ,  SUMO , and  DOLCE .   [ 13 ]      [ 14 ]     WordNet , while considered an upper ontology by some, is not strictly an ontology. However, it has been employed as a linguistic tool for learning domain ontologies.   [ 15 ]    \n  Hybrid ontology   [  edit  ]   \n The  Gellish  ontology is an example of a combination of an upper and a domain ontology. \n  Ontology Visualization   [  edit  ]   \n A survey of ontology visualization techniques is presented by Katifori et al.   [ 16 ]    An evaluation of two most established ontology visualization techniques: indented tree and graph is discussed in.   [ 17 ]    \n  Ontology engineering   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ontology engineering  \n  Ontology engineering  (or ontology building) is a subfield of  knowledge engineering . It studies the ontology development process, the ontology life cycle, the methods and methodologies for building ontologies, and the tool suites and languages that support them.   [ 18 ]      [ 19 ]    \n Ontology engineering aims to make explicit the knowledge contained within software applications, and within enterprises and business procedures for a particular domain. Ontology engineering offers a direction towards solving the interoperability problems brought about by semantic obstacles, such as the obstacles related to the definitions of business terms and software classes. Ontology engineering is a set of tasks related to the development of ontologies for a particular domain.   [ 20 ]    \n  Ontology editor   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ontology editor  \n   \n  Ontology learning   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ontology learning  \n Ontology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting a domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor intensive and time consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process. \n  Ontology languages   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Ontology language  \n \n \n   \n  It has been suggested that portions of this section be  moved  into   Ontology language  . ( Discuss )  \n \n \n An  ontology language  is a  formal language  used to encode the ontology. There are a number of such languages for ontologies, both proprietary and standards-based: \n \n  Common Algebraic Specification Language  is a general logic-based specification language developed within the IFIP working group 1.3 \"Foundations of System Specifications\" and functions as a de facto standard in the area of software specifications. It is now being applied to ontology specifications in order to provide modularity and structuring mechanisms. \n  Common logic  is ISO standard 24707, a specification for a family of ontology languages that can be accurately translated into each other. \n The  Cyc  project has its own ontology language called  CycL , based on  first-order predicate calculus  with some higher-order extensions. \n  DOGMA  (Developing Ontology-Grounded Methods and Applications) adopts the fact-oriented modeling approach to provide a higher level of semantic stability. \n The  Gellish  language includes rules for its own extension and thus integrates an ontology with an ontology language. \n  IDEF5  is a  software engineering  method to develop and maintain usable, accurate, domain ontologies. \n  KIF  is a syntax for  first-order logic  that is based on  S-expressions . \n  MOF  and  UML  are standards of the  OMG  \n  OBO , a language used for biological and biomedical ontologies. \n  OntoUML  is an ontologically well-founded profile of UML for conceptutal modeling of domain ontologies. \n  OWL  is a language for making ontological statements, developed as a follow-on from  RDF  and  RDFS , as well as earlier ontology language projects including  OIL ,  DAML , and  DAML+OIL . OWL is intended to be used over the  World Wide Web , and all its elements (classes, properties and individuals) are defined as RDF  resources , and identified by  URIs . \n  Rule Interchange Format  (RIF) and  F-Logic  combine ontologies and rules. \n  Semantic Application Design Language  (SADL)   [ 21 ]    captures a subset of the expressiveness of  OWL , using an English-like language entered via an  Eclipse  Plug-in. \n  SBVR  (Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules) is an OMG standard adopted in industry to build ontologies. \n  TOVE Project , TOronto Virtual Enterprise project \n \n  Examples of published ontologies   [  edit  ]   \n \n  BabelNet , a very large multilingual semantic network and ontology, lexicalized in many languages \n Basic Formal Ontology,   [ 22 ]    a formal upper ontology designed to support scientific research \n BioPAX,   [ 23 ]    an ontology for the exchange and interoperability of biological pathway (cellular processes) data \n BMO,   [ 24 ]    an e-Business Model Ontology based on a review of enterprise ontologies and business model literature \n CCO and GexKB,   [ 25 ]    Application Ontologies (APO) that integrate diverse types of knowledge with the Cell Cycle Ontology (CCO) and the Gene Expression Knowledge Base (GexKB) \n CContology (Customer Complaint Ontology),   [ 26 ]    an e-business ontology to support online customer complaint management \n  CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model , an ontology for  cultural heritage    [ 27 ]    \n COSMO,   [ 28 ]    a Foundation Ontology (current version in OWL) that is designed to contain representations of all of the primitive concepts needed to logically specify the meanings of any domain entity. It is intended to serve as a basic ontology that can be used to translate among the representations in other ontologies or databases. It started as a merger of the basic elements of the OpenCyc and SUMO ontologies, and has been supplemented with other ontology elements (types, relations) so as to include representations of all of the words in the Longman dictionary defining vocabulary. \n  Cyc , a large Foundation Ontology for formal representation of the universe of discourse \n  Disease Ontology ,   [ 29 ]    designed to facilitate the mapping of diseases and associated conditions to particular medical codes \n  DOLCE , a Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering   [ 13 ]      [ 14 ]    \n  Dublin Core , a simple ontology for documents and publishing \n Foundational, Core and Linguistic Ontologies   [ 30 ]    \n  Foundational Model of Anatomy ,   [ 31 ]    an ontology for human anatomy \n  Friend of a Friend , an ontology for describing persons, their activities and their relations to other people and objects \n  Gene Ontology  for  genomics  \n  Gellish English dictionary , an ontology that includes a dictionary and taxonomy that includes an upper ontology and a lower ontology that focusses on industrial and business applications in engineering, technology and procurement.

He writes 'before one is able to answer the question 'what is an ontology?', one must provide first an answer to the question 'what does the word ontology mean?'.

See the main article on  Cybernetics . \n Some important work on information and communication was done by  Gregory Bateson  and his colleagues. \n  Study of language and information   [  edit  ]   \n Later contributions to the field were made by  Fred Dretske ,  Jon Barwise ,  Brian Cantwell Smith , and others. \n The  Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI)  was founded at Stanford University in 1983 by philosophers, computer scientists, linguists, and psychologists, under the direction of  John Perry  and  Jon Barwise . \n  P.I.   [  edit  ]   \n More recently this field has become known as the philosophy of information. The expression was coined in the 1990s by  Luciano Floridi , who has published prolifically in this area with the intention of elaborating a unified and coherent, conceptual frame for the whole subject. \n  Definitions of \"information\"   [  edit  ]   \n The concept  information  has been defined by several theorists. \n  Peirce   [  edit  ]   \n  Charles S. Peirce 's theory of information was embedded in his wider theory of symbolic communication he called the  semeiotic , now a major part of  semiotics . For Peirce, information integrates the aspects of  signs  and  expressions  separately covered by the concepts of  denotation  and  extension , on the one hand, and by  connotation  and  comprehension  on the other. \n  Shannon and Weaver   [  edit  ]   \n Claude E. Shannon, for his part, was very cautious: \"The word 'information' has been given different meanings by various writers in the general field of information theory. It is likely that at least a number of these will prove sufficiently useful in certain applications to deserve further study and permanent recognition. It is hardly to be expected that a single concept of information would satisfactorily account for the numerous possible applications of this general field.\" (Shannon 1993, p.\u00a0180). Thus, following Shannon, Weaver supported a tripartite analysis of information in terms of (1) technical problems concerning the quantification of information and dealt with by Shannon's theory; (2) semantic problems relating to meaning and truth; and (3) what he called \"influential\" problems concerning the impact and effectiveness of information on human behaviour, which he thought had to play an equally important role. And these are only two early examples of the problems raised by any analysis of information. \n A map of the main senses in which one may speak of information is provided by  the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article . The previous paragraphs are based on it. \n  Bateson   [  edit  ]   \n  Gregory Bateson  defined information as \"a difference that makes a difference\".   [ 2 ]    which is based on  MacKay : information is a distinction that makes a difference.   [ 3 ]    \n  Floridi   [  edit  ]   \n According to Luciano Floridi, four kinds of mutually compatible phenomena are commonly referred to as \"information\": \n \n Information about something (e.g. a train timetable) \n Information as something (e.g. DNA, or fingerprints) \n Information for something (e.g. algorithms or instructions) \n Information in something (e.g. a pattern or a constraint). \n \n The word \"information\" is commonly used so metaphorically or so abstractly that the meaning is unclear. \n  Philosophical directions   [  edit  ]   \n  Computing and philosophy   [  edit  ]   \n Recent creative advances and efforts in  computing , such as  semantic web ,  ontology engineering ,  knowledge engineering , and modern  artificial intelligence  provide  philosophy  with fertile notions, new and evolving subject matters, methodologies, and models for philosophical inquiry. While  computer science  brings new opportunities and challenges to traditional philosophical studies, and changes the ways philosophers understand foundational concepts in philosophy, further major progress in  computer science  would only be feasible when philosophy provides sound foundations for areas such as bioinformatics, software engineering, knowledge engineering, and ontologies. \n Classical topics in philosophy, namely,  mind ,  consciousness ,  experience ,  reasoning ,  knowledge ,  truth ,  morality  and  creativity  are rapidly becoming common concerns and foci of investigation in  computer science , e.g., in areas such as agent computing,  software agents , and intelligent mobile agent technologies. [   citation needed   ]  \n According to L. Floridi \"   [ 4 ]    one can think of several ways for applying computational methods towards philosophical matters: \n \n Conceptual experiments in silico: As an innovative extension of an ancient tradition of  thought experiment , a trend has begun in philosophy to apply computational  modeling  schemes to questions in  logic ,  epistemology ,  philosophy of science ,  philosophy of biology ,  philosophy of mind , and so on. \n Pancomputationalism: By this view, computational and informational concepts are considered to be so powerful that given the right Level of  abstraction , anything in the world could be modeled and represented as a computational system, and any process could be simulated computationally. Then, however, pancomputationalists have the hard task of providing credible answers to the following two questions:\n \n how can one avoid blurring all differences among systems? \n what would it mean for the system under investigation not to be an  informational system  (or a computational system, if computation is the same as information processing)? \n \n \n \n  Information and society   [  edit  ]   \n Philosophical studies of the social and cultural aspects of electronically mediated information have been carried out by numerous philosophers and other thinkers. \n \n  Albert Borgmann , Holding onto Reality: The Nature of Information at the Turn of the Millennium (Chicago University Press, 1999) \n  Mark Poster , The Mode of Information (Chicago Press, 1990) \n  Luciano Floridi , Informational Nature of Reality, Key Talk selected at the E-CAP conference 2006 (Trondheim, 2006) \n \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n \n  Barwise prize  \n  Complex system  \n  Digital philosophy  \n  Digital physics  \n  Game theory  \n  Informatics  \n \n \n \n \n  Information  \n  Information art  \n  Information ethics  \n  Information philosophy  \n  Information theory  \n  International Association for Computing and Philosophy  \n  Logic of information  \n \n \n \n \n  Philosophy of artificial intelligence  \n  Philosophy of computer science  \n  Philosophy of technology  \n  Philosophy of thermal and statistical physics  \n  Physical information  \n  Relational quantum mechanics  \n  Social informatics  \n  Statistical mechanics  \n \n \n \n \n  Notes   [  edit  ]   \n \n    ^     Luciano Floridi,  \"What is the Philosophy of Information?\" ,  Metaphilosophy , 2002, (33), 1/2.  \n    ^      Extract from \"Steps to an Ecology of Mind\"   \n    ^     The Philosophy of Information.

Information theory was developed by  Claude E. Shannon  to find fundamental limits on  signal processing  operations such as  compressing data  and on reliably  storing  and  communicating  data. Since its inception it has broadened to find applications in many other areas, including  statistical inference ,  natural language processing ,  cryptography ,  neurobiology ,   [ 1 ]    the evolution   [ 2 ]    and function   [ 3 ]    of molecular codes, model selection in ecology,   [ 4 ]    thermal physics,   [ 5 ]     quantum computing , plagiarism detection   [ 6 ]    and other forms of  data analysis .   [ 7 ]    In  Three Roads to Quantum Gravity  cosmologist Lee Smolin provides a strong theoretical argument that, at the smallest scale, the fabric of space and time is nothing more than the exchange of discrete bits of information. If true, relativity and quantum theories are unified, and Shannon entropy could be considered physics' most basic law. \n A key measure of information is  entropy , which is usually expressed by the average number of bits needed to store or communicate one  symbol  in a message. Entropy quantifies the uncertainty involved in predicting the value of a  random variable . For example, specifying the outcome of a fair  coin flip  (two equally likely outcomes) provides less information (lower entropy) than specifying the outcome from a roll of a  die  (six equally likely outcomes). \n Applications of fundamental topics of information theory include  lossless data compression  (e.g.  ZIP files ),  lossy data compression  (e.g.  MP3s  and  JPEGs ), and  channel coding  (e.g. for  Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) ). The field is at the intersection of  mathematics ,  statistics ,  computer science ,  physics ,  neurobiology , and  electrical engineering . Its impact has been crucial to the success of the  Voyager  missions to deep space, the invention of the compact disc, the feasibility of mobile phones, the development of the  Internet , the study of  linguistics  and of human perception, the understanding of  black holes , and numerous other fields. Important sub-fields of information theory are  source coding ,  channel coding ,  algorithmic complexity theory ,  algorithmic information theory ,  information-theoretic security , and measures of information. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Overview   \n   2   Historical background   \n   3   Quantities of information  \n \n   3.1   Entropy   \n   3.2   Joint entropy   \n   3.3   Conditional entropy (equivocation)   \n   3.4   Mutual information (transinformation)   \n   3.5   Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (information gain)   \n   3.6   Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence of a prior from the truth   \n   3.7   Other quantities   \n \n \n   4   Coding theory  \n \n   4.1   Source theory  \n \n   4.1.1   Rate   \n \n \n   4.2   Channel capacity  \n \n   4.2.1   Capacity of particular channel models   \n \n \n \n \n   5   Applications to other fields  \n \n   5.1   Intelligence uses and secrecy applications   \n   5.2   Pseudorandom number generation   \n   5.3   Seismic exploration   \n   5.4   Semiotics   \n   5.5   Miscellaneous applications   \n \n \n   6   See also  \n \n   6.1   Applications   \n   6.2   History   \n   6.3   Theory   \n   6.4   Concepts   \n \n \n   7   References  \n \n   7.1   The classic work   \n   7.2   Other journal articles   \n   7.3   Textbooks on information theory   \n   7.4   Other books   \n \n \n   8   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Overview   [  edit  ]   \n The main concepts of information theory can be grasped by considering the most widespread means of human communication: language. Two important aspects of a concise language are as follows: First, the most common words (e.g., \"a\", \"the\", \"I\") should be shorter than less common words (e.g., \"roundabout\", \"generation\", \"mediocre\",) so that sentences will not be too long. Such a tradeoff in word length is analogous to  data compression  and is the essential aspect of  source coding . Second, if part of a sentence is unheard or misheard due to noise \u2014 e.g., a passing car \u2014 the listener should still be able to glean the meaning of the underlying message. Such robustness is as essential for an electronic communication system as it is for a language; properly building such robustness into communications is done by  channel coding . Source coding and channel coding are the fundamental concerns of information theory. \n Note that these concerns have nothing to do with the  importance  of messages. For example, a platitude such as \"Thank you; come again\" takes about as long to say or write as the urgent plea, \"Call an ambulance!\" while the latter may be more important and more meaningful in many contexts. Information theory, however, does not consider message importance or meaning, as these are matters of the quality of data rather than the quantity and readability of data, the latter of which is determined solely by probabilities. \n Information theory is generally considered to have been founded in 1948 by  Claude Shannon  in his seminal work, \" A Mathematical Theory of Communication \". The central paradigm of classical information theory is the engineering problem of the transmission of information over a noisy channel. The most fundamental results of this theory are Shannon's  source coding theorem , which establishes that, on average, the number of  bits  needed to represent the result of an uncertain event is given by its  entropy ; and Shannon's  noisy-channel coding theorem , which states that  reliable  communication is possible over  noisy  channels provided that the rate of communication is below a certain threshold, called the channel capacity. The channel capacity can be approached in practice by using appropriate encoding and decoding systems. \n Information theory is closely associated with a collection of pure and applied disciplines that have been investigated and reduced to engineering practice under a variety of  rubrics  throughout the world over the past half century or more:  adaptive systems ,  anticipatory systems ,  artificial intelligence ,  complex systems ,  complexity science ,  cybernetics ,  informatics ,  machine learning , along with  systems sciences  of many descriptions. Information theory is a broad and deep mathematical theory, with equally broad and deep applications, amongst which is the vital field of  coding theory . \n Coding theory is concerned with finding explicit methods, called  codes , of increasing the efficiency and reducing the net error rate of data communication over a noisy channel to near the limit that Shannon proved is the maximum possible for that channel. These codes can be roughly subdivided into  data compression  (source coding) and  error-correction  (channel coding) techniques. In the latter case, it took many years to find the methods Shannon's work proved were possible. A third class of information theory codes are cryptographic algorithms (both  codes  and  ciphers ). Concepts, methods and results from coding theory and information theory are widely used in  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis .  See the article  ban (information)  for a historical application.  \n Information theory is also used in  information retrieval ,  intelligence gathering ,  gambling ,  statistics , and even in  musical composition . \n  Historical background   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  History of information theory  \n The landmark event that established the discipline of information theory, and brought it to immediate worldwide attention, was the publication of  Claude E. Shannon 's classic paper \" A Mathematical Theory of Communication \" in the   Bell System Technical Journal   in July and October 1948. \n Prior to this paper, limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at  Bell Labs , all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.  Harry Nyquist 's 1924 paper,  Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed,  contains a theoretical section quantifying \"intelligence\" and the \"line speed\" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system, giving the relation   (recalling  Boltzmann's Constant ), where  W  is the speed of transmission of intelligence,  m  is the number of different voltage levels to choose from at each time step, and  K  is a constant.  Ralph Hartley 's 1928 paper,  Transmission of Information,  uses the word  information  as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other, thus quantifying information as  , where  S  was the number of possible symbols, and  n  the number of symbols in a transmission. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the  hartley  in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.  Alan Turing  in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war  Enigma  ciphers. \n Much of the mathematics behind information theory with events of different probabilities were developed for the field of  thermodynamics  by  Ludwig Boltzmann  and  J. Willard Gibbs . Connections between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy, including the important contributions by  Rolf Landauer  in the 1960s, are explored in   Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory  . \n In Shannon's revolutionary and groundbreaking paper, the work for which had been substantially completed at Bell Labs by the end of 1944, Shannon for the first time introduced the qualitative and quantitative model of communication as a statistical process underlying information theory, opening with the assertion that \n \n \"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point, either exactly or approximately, a message selected at another point.\" \n \n With it came the ideas of \n \n the  information entropy  and  redundancy  of a source, and its relevance through the  source coding theorem ; \n the  mutual information , and the  channel capacity  of a noisy channel, including the promise of perfect loss-free communication given by the  noisy-channel coding theorem ; \n the practical result of the  Shannon\u2013Hartley law  for the channel capacity of a  Gaussian channel ; as well as \n the  bit \u2014a new way of seeing the most fundamental unit of information. \n \n  Quantities of information   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Quantities of information  \n Information theory is based on  probability theory  and  statistics . The most important quantities of information are  entropy , the information in a  random variable , and  mutual information , the amount of information in common between two random variables. The former quantity indicates how easily message data can be  compressed  while the latter can be used to find the communication rate across a  channel . \n The choice of logarithmic base in the following formulae determines the  unit  of  information entropy  that is used. The most common unit of information is the  bit , based on the  binary logarithm . Other units include the  nat , which is based on the  natural logarithm , and the  hartley , which is based on the  common logarithm . \n In what follows, an expression of the form   is considered by convention to be equal to zero whenever   This is justified because   for any logarithmic base. \n  Entropy   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nEntropy of a  Bernoulli trial  as a function of success probability, often called the   binary entropy function  ,  . The entropy is maximized at 1 bit per trial when the two possible outcomes are equally probable, as in an unbiased coin toss. \n \n \n The   entropy  ,  , of a discrete random variable   is a measure of the amount of  uncertainty  associated with the value of  . \n Suppose one transmits 1000 bits (0s and 1s). If these bits are known ahead of transmission (to be a certain value with absolute probability), logic dictates that no information has been transmitted. If, however, each is equally and independently likely to be 0 or 1, 1000 bits (in the information theoretic sense) have been transmitted. Between these two extremes, information can be quantified as follows. If   is the set of all messages   that   could be, and   is the probability of some  , then the entropy,  , of   is defined:   [ 8 ]    \n \n   \n \n (Here,   is the  self-information , which is the entropy contribution of an individual message, and   is the  expected value .) An important property of entropy is that it is maximized when all the messages in the message space are equiprobable  ,\u2014i.e., most unpredictable\u2014in which case  . \n The special case of information entropy for a random variable with two outcomes is the   binary entropy function  , usually taken to the logarithmic base 2: \n \n   \n \n  Joint entropy   [  edit  ]   \n The   joint entropy   of two discrete random variables   and   is merely the entropy of their pairing:  . This implies that if   and   are  independent , then their joint entropy is the sum of their individual entropies. \n For example, if   represents the position of a  chess  piece \u2014   the row and   the column, then the joint entropy of the row of the piece and the column of the piece will be the entropy of the position of the piece. \n \n   \n \n Despite similar notation, joint entropy should not be confused with   cross entropy  . \n  Conditional entropy (equivocation)   [  edit  ]   \n The   conditional entropy   or  conditional uncertainty  of   given random variable   (also called the  equivocation  of   about  ) is the average conditional entropy over  :   [ 9 ]    \n \n   \n \n Because entropy can be conditioned on a random variable or on that random variable being a certain value, care should be taken not to confuse these two definitions of conditional entropy, the former of which is in more common use. A basic property of this form of conditional entropy is that: \n \n   \n \n  Mutual information (transinformation)   [  edit  ]   \n   Mutual information   measures the amount of information that can be obtained about one random variable by observing another. It is important in communication where it can be used to maximize the amount of information shared between sent and received signals. The mutual information of   relative to   is given by: \n \n   \n \n where   ( S pecific mutual  I nformation) is the  pointwise mutual information . \n A basic property of the mutual information is that \n \n   \n \n That is, knowing  Y , we can save an average of   bits in encoding  X  compared to not knowing  Y . \n Mutual information is  symmetric : \n \n   \n \n Mutual information can be expressed as the average  Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence  (information gain) between the  posterior probability distribution  of  X  given the value of  Y  and the  prior distribution  on  X : \n \n   \n \n In other words, this is a measure of how much, on the average, the probability distribution on  X  will change if we are given the value of  Y . This is often recalculated as the divergence from the product of the marginal distributions to the actual joint distribution: \n \n   \n \n Mutual information is closely related to the  log-likelihood ratio test  in the context of contingency tables and the  multinomial distribution  and to  Pearson's \u03c7 2  test : mutual information can be considered a statistic for assessing independence between a pair of variables, and has a well-specified asymptotic distribution. \n  Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (information gain)   [  edit  ]   \n The   Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence   (or  information divergence ,  information gain , or  relative entropy ) is a way of comparing two distributions: a \"true\"  probability distribution   p(X) , and an arbitrary probability distribution  q(X) . If we compress data in a manner that assumes  q(X)  is the distribution underlying some data, when, in reality,  p(X)  is the correct distribution, the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence is the number of average additional bits per datum necessary for compression. It is thus defined \n \n   \n \n Although it is sometimes used as a 'distance metric', KL divergence is not a true  metric  since it is not symmetric and does not satisfy the  triangle inequality  (making it a semi-quasimetric). \n  Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence of a prior from the truth   [  edit  ]   \n Another interpretation of KL divergence is this: suppose a number  X  is about to be drawn randomly from a discrete set with probability distribution  p(x) . If Alice knows the true distribution  p(x) , while Bob believes (has a prior) that the distribution is  q(x) , then Bob will be more  surprised  than Alice, on average, upon seeing the value of  X . The KL divergence is the (objective) expected value of the Bob's (subjective)  surprisal  minus Alice's surprisal, measured in bits if the  log  is in base 2. In this way, the extent to which Bob's prior is \"wrong\" can be quantified in terms of how \"unnecessarily surprised\" it's expected to make him. \n  Other quantities   [  edit  ]   \n Other important information theoretic quantities include  R\u00e9nyi entropy  (a generalization of entropy),  differential entropy  (a generalization of quantities of information to continuous distributions), and the  conditional mutual information . \n  Coding theory   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Coding theory  \n \n    \n \n     \nA picture showing scratches on the readable surface of a CD-R. Music and data CDs are coded using error correcting codes and thus can still be read even if they have minor scratches using  error detection and correction . \n \n \n  Coding theory  is one of the most important and direct applications of information theory. It can be subdivided into  source coding  theory and  channel coding  theory. Using a statistical description for data, information theory quantifies the number of bits needed to describe the data, which is the information entropy of the source. \n \n Data compression (source coding): There are two formulations for the compression problem: \n \n \n  lossless data compression : the data must be reconstructed exactly; \n  lossy data compression : allocates bits needed to reconstruct the data, within a specified fidelity level measured by a distortion function. This subset of Information theory is called  rate\u2013distortion theory . \n \n \n Error-correcting codes (channel coding): While data compression removes as much  redundancy  as possible, an error correcting code adds just the right kind of redundancy (i.e.,  error correction ) needed to transmit the data efficiently and faithfully across a noisy channel. \n \n This division of coding theory into compression and transmission is justified by the information transmission theorems, or source\u2013channel separation theorems that justify the use of bits as the universal currency for information in many contexts. However, these theorems only hold in the situation where one transmitting user wishes to communicate to one receiving user. In scenarios with more than one transmitter (the multiple-access channel), more than one receiver (the  broadcast channel ) or intermediary \"helpers\" (the  relay channel ), or more general  networks , compression followed by transmission may no longer be optimal.  Network information theory  refers to these multi-agent communication models. \n  Source theory   [  edit  ]   \n Any process that generates successive messages can be considered a   source   of information. A memoryless source is one in which each message is an  independent identically distributed random variable , whereas the properties of  ergodicity  and  stationarity  impose more general constraints. All such sources are  stochastic . These terms are well studied in their own right outside information theory. \n  Rate   [  edit  ]   \n Information   rate   is the average entropy per symbol. For memoryless sources, this is merely the entropy of each symbol, while, in the case of a stationary stochastic process, it is \n \n   \n \n that is, the conditional entropy of a symbol given all the previous symbols generated. For the more general case of a process that is not necessarily stationary, the  average rate  is \n \n   \n \n that is, the limit of the joint entropy per symbol. For stationary sources, these two expressions give the same result.   [ 10 ]    \n It is common in information theory to speak of the \"rate\" or \"entropy\" of a language. This is appropriate, for example, when the source of information is English prose. The rate of a source of information is related to its  redundancy  and how well it can be  compressed , the subject of  source coding . \n  Channel capacity   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Channel capacity  \n Communications over a channel\u2014such as an  ethernet   cable \u2014is the primary motivation of information theory. As anyone who's ever used a telephone (mobile or landline) knows, however, such channels often fail to produce exact reconstruction of a signal; noise, periods of silence, and other forms of signal corruption often degrade quality. How much information can one hope to communicate over a noisy (or otherwise imperfect) channel? \n Consider the communications process over a discrete channel. A simple model of the process is shown below: \n \n     \n \n Here  X  represents the space of messages transmitted, and  Y  the space of messages received during a unit time over our channel. Let   be the  conditional probability  distribution function of  Y  given  X . We will consider   to be an inherent fixed property of our communications channel (representing the nature of the   noise   of our channel). Then the joint distribution of  X  and  Y  is completely determined by our channel and by our choice of  , the marginal distribution of messages we choose to send over the channel. Under these constraints, we would like to maximize the rate of information, or the   signal  , we can communicate over the channel. The appropriate measure for this is the  mutual information , and this maximum mutual information is called the   channel capacity   and is given by: \n \n   \n \n This capacity has the following property related to communicating at information rate  R  (where  R  is usually bits per symbol). For any information rate  R &lt; C  and coding error \u03b5 &gt; 0, for large enough  N , there exists a code of length  N  and rate \u2265 R and a decoding algorithm, such that the maximal probability of block error is \u2264 \u03b5; that is, it is always possible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error. In addition, for any rate  R &gt; C , it is impossible to transmit with arbitrarily small block error. \n   Channel coding   is concerned with finding such nearly optimal  codes  that can be used to transmit data over a noisy channel with a small coding error at a rate near the channel capacity. \n  Capacity of particular channel models   [  edit  ]   \n \n A continuous-time analog communications channel subject to  Gaussian noise  \u2014 see  Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem . \n \n \n A  binary symmetric channel  (BSC) with crossover probability  p  is a binary input, binary output channel that flips the input bit with probability  p . The BSC has a capacity of   bits per channel use, where   is the  binary entropy function  to the base 2 logarithm: \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n A  binary erasure channel  (BEC) with erasure probability  p  is a binary input, ternary output channel. The possible channel outputs are  0 ,  1 , and a third symbol 'e' called an erasure. The erasure represents complete loss of information about an input bit. The capacity of the BEC is  1 - p  bits per channel use. \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n  Applications to other fields   [  edit  ]   \n  Intelligence uses and secrecy applications   [  edit  ]   \n Information theoretic concepts apply to  cryptography  and  cryptanalysis .  Turing 's information unit, the  ban , was used in the  Ultra  project, breaking the German  Enigma machine  code and hastening the  end of WWII in Europe . Shannon himself defined an important concept now called the  unicity distance . Based on the  redundancy  of the  plaintext , it attempts to give a minimum amount of  ciphertext  necessary to ensure unique decipherability. \n Information theory leads us to believe it is much more difficult to keep secrets than it might first appear. A  brute force attack  can break systems based on  asymmetric key algorithms  or on most commonly used methods of  symmetric key algorithms  (sometimes called secret key algorithms), such as  block ciphers . The security of all such methods currently comes from the assumption that no known attack can break them in a practical amount of time. \n  Information theoretic security  refers to methods such as the  one-time pad  that are not vulnerable to such brute force attacks. In such cases, the positive conditional  mutual information  between the  plaintext  and  ciphertext  (conditioned on the  key ) can ensure proper transmission, while the unconditional mutual information between the plaintext and ciphertext remains zero, resulting in absolutely secure communications. In other words, an eavesdropper would not be able to improve his or her guess of the plaintext by gaining knowledge of the ciphertext but not of the key. However, as in any other cryptographic system, care must be used to correctly apply even information-theoretically secure methods; the  Venona project  was able to crack the one-time pads of the  Soviet Union  due to their improper reuse of key material. \n  Pseudorandom number generation   [  edit  ]   \n  Pseudorandom number generators  are widely available in computer language libraries and application programs. They are, almost universally, unsuited to cryptographic use as they do not evade the deterministic nature of modern computer equipment and software. A class of improved random number generators is termed  cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators , but even they require external to the software  random seeds  to work as intended. These can be obtained via  extractors , if done carefully. The measure of sufficient randomness in extractors is  min-entropy , a value related to Shannon entropy through  R\u00e9nyi entropy ; R\u00e9nyi entropy is also used in evaluating randomness in cryptographic systems. Although related, the distinctions among these measures mean that a  random variable  with high Shannon entropy is not necessarily satisfactory for use in an extractor and so for cryptography uses. \n  Seismic exploration   [  edit  ]   \n One early commercial application of information theory was in the field seismic oil exploration. Work in this field made it possible to strip off and separate the unwanted noise from the desired seismic signal. Information theory and  digital signal processing  offer a major improvement of resolution and image clarity over previous analog methods.   [ 11 ]    \n  Semiotics   [  edit  ]   \n Concepts from information theory such as redundancy and code control have been used by  semioticians  such as Umberto Eco and Rossi-Landi to explain ideology as a form of message transmission whereby a dominant social class emits its message by using signs that exhibit a high degree of redundancy such that only one message is decoded among a selection of competing ones.   [ 12 ]    \n  Miscellaneous applications   [  edit  ]   \n Information theory also has applications in  gambling and investing ,  black holes ,  bioinformatics , and  music . \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n     \n  Mathematics portal  \n \n \n \n \n  Communication theory  \n  List of important publications  \n  Philosophy of information  \n \n  Applications   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Cryptanalysis  \n  Cryptography  \n  Cybernetics  \n  Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory  \n  Gambling  \n  Intelligence (information gathering)  \n  Seismic exploration  \n \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Hartley, R.V.L.  \n  History of information theory  \n  Shannon, C.E.  \n  Timeline of information theory  \n  Yockey, H.P.  \n \n  Theory   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n  Coding theory  \n  Detection theory  \n  Estimation theory  \n  Fisher information  \n  Information algebra  \n  Information asymmetry  \n  Information geometry  \n  Information theory and measure theory  \n  Kolmogorov complexity  \n  Logic of information  \n  Network coding  \n  Philosophy of Information  \n  Quantum information science  \n  Semiotic information theory  \n  Source coding  \n \n \n  Concepts   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n  ban (information)  \n  Channel capacity  \n  Channel (communications)  \n  Communication source  \n  Conditional entropy  \n  Covert channel  \n  Decoder  \n  Differential entropy  \n  Encoder  \n  Information entropy  \n  Joint entropy  \n  Kullback-Leibler divergence  \n  Mutual information  \n  Pointwise Mutual Information  (PMI) \n  Receiver (information theory)  \n  Redundancy  \n  R\u00e9nyi entropy  \n  Self-information  \n  Unicity distance  \n  Variety  \n \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^      F.

With collections of works, lecture halls, meeting rooms, and gardens, the library was part of a larger research institution called the  Musaeum of Alexandria , where many of the most famous thinkers of the ancient world studied. \n The library was conceived and opened either during the reign of  Ptolemy I Soter  (323\u2013283 BCE) or during the reign of his son  Ptolemy\u00a0II  (283\u2013246 BCE). As a symbol of the wealth and power of Egypt, it employed many scribes to borrow books from around the known world, copy them, and return them. Most of the books were kept as  papyrus  scrolls, and though it is unknown how many such scrolls were housed at any given time, their combined value was incalculable. \n The library is famous for having been burned, resulting in the loss of many scrolls and books, and has become a symbol of the destruction of cultural knowledge. Ancient sources differ widely on who is responsible for the destruction and when it occurred. Although there is a mythology of  the  burning of the Library at Alexandria, the library may have suffered several fires or acts of destruction over many years. Possible occasions for the partial or complete destruction of the Library of Alexandria include a fire set by  Julius Caesar  in 48 BCE, an attack by  Aurelian  in the 270s AD, the decree of Coptic  Pope Theophilus  in 391, and the  Muslim conquest of Egypt  in 642. \n After the main library was fully destroyed, ancient scholars used a \"daughter library\" in a temple known as the  Serapeum , located in another part of the city. According to  Socrates of Constantinople , Coptic Pope Theophilus destroyed the Serapeum in 391 AD. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Structure   \n   2   Collection   \n   3   History  \n \n   3.1   Destruction   \n \n \n   4   Legacy  \n \n   4.1   Modern day   \n \n \n   5   References   \n   6   Sources   \n   7   Further reading   \n   8   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Structure   [  edit  ]   \n Although the exact layout is not known, ancient sources describe the Library of Alexandria as comprising a collection of scrolls, a  peripatos  walk, a room for shared dining, a reading room, meeting rooms, gardens, and lecture halls. The influence of this model may still be seen today in the layout of university campuses. The library itself is known to have had an acquisitions department (possibly built near the stacks, or for utility closer to the harbour), and a cataloguing department. A hall contained shelves for the collections of papyrus scrolls known as  bibliothekai  ( \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b8\u1fc6\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 ). According to popular description, an inscription above the shelves read:  The place of the cure of the soul.    [ 1 ]    \n The library was but one part of the  Musaeum of Alexandria , which functioned as a sort of research institute. In addition to the library the Musaeum included rooms for the study of astronomy, anatomy, and even a zoo of exotic animals. The classical thinkers who studied, wrote, and experimented at the Musaeum include the fathers of mathematics, engineering, physiology, geography, and medicine. These included notable thinkers such as  Euclid ,  Archimedes ,  Eratosthenes ,  Herophilus ,  Erasistratus ,  Hipparchus ,  Aedesia ,  Pappus ,  Theon ,  Hypatia ,  Aristarchus of Samos , and  Saint Catherine .   [ 2 ]    \n  Collection   [  edit  ]   \n It is now impossible to determine the collection's size in any era with any certainty.  Papyrus  scrolls constituted the collection, and although  codices  were used after 300 BCE, the Alexandrian Library is never documented as having switched to parchment, perhaps because of its strong links to the papyrus trade. (The Library of Alexandria in fact had an indirect cause in the creation of writing parchment\u00a0\u2014 due to the library's critical need for papyrus, little was exported and thus an alternate source of copy material became essential.)   [ 3 ]    \n A single piece of writing might occupy several scrolls, and this division into self-contained \"books\" was a major aspect of editorial work. King  Ptolemy II Philadelphus  (309\u2013246 BCE) is said to have set 500,000 scrolls as an objective for the library.   [ 4 ]     Mark Antony  supposedly gave  Cleopatra  over 200,000 scrolls for the library as a wedding gift, taken from the great  Library of Pergamum , but this is regarded by some historians as a propagandist claim meant to show Antony's allegiance to Egypt rather than Rome.   [ 5 ]    No index of the library survives, and it is not possible to know with certainty how large and how diverse the collection may have been. For example, it is likely that even if the Library of Alexandria had hundreds of thousands of scrolls (and thus perhaps tens of thousands of individual  works ), some of these would have been duplicate copies or alternate versions of the same texts. [   citation needed   ]  [   original research?   ]  \n As a research institution the library filled its stacks with new works in mathematics, astronomy, physics, natural sciences and other subjects. Its empirical standards applied in one of the first and certainly strongest homes for serious  textual criticism . As the same text often existed in several different versions, comparative textual criticism was crucial for ensuring their veracity. Once ascertained, canonical copies would then be made for scholars, royalty, and wealthy bibliophiles the world over, this commerce bringing income to the library.   [ 6 ]    \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nThis Latin inscription regarding  Tiberius Claudius Balbilus  of Rome (d. c. AD 79) mentions the \"ALEXANDRINA BYBLIOTHECE\" (line eight). \n \n \n Though almost all ancient sources agree that the Alexandrian library was one of the largest and most significant  libraries of the ancient world ,   [ 7 ]    details about the library are a mixture of history and legend.   [ 8 ]    The library's main purpose was to show off the wealth of Egypt, with research as a lesser goal,   [ 9 ]    but the library's contents were used to aid the ruler of Egypt.   [ 8 ]    \n According to the earliest source of information, the  pseudepigraphic    Letter of Aristeas   composed between c180 and 145 BCE,   [ 9 ]    the library was initially organized by  Demetrius of Phaleron ,   [ 10 ]    a student of  Aristotle , under the reign of  Ptolemy I Soter  (c.367 BCE\u2014c.283 BCE). Other sources claim it was instead created under the reign of his son  Ptolemy\u00a0II  (283\u2013246 BCE).   [ 11 ]    The Library was built in the Brucheion (Royal Quarter) in the style of Aristotle's Lyceum, adjacent to and in service of the  Musaeum  (a Greek Temple or \"House of Muses\", whence the term \"museum\").   [ 12 ]    \n The Library at Alexandria was in charge of collecting all the world's knowledge, and most of the staff was occupied with the task of translating works onto papyrus paper.   [ 8 ]    It did so through an aggressive and well-funded royal mandate involving trips to the book fairs of  Rhodes  and  Athens .   [ 13 ]    According to  Galen , any books found on ships that came into port were taken to the library,   [ 11 ]    and were listed as \" books of the ships \".   [ 14 ]    Official scribes then copied these writings; the originals were kept in the library, and the copies delivered to the owners.   [ 14 ]    Other than collecting works from the past, the library served as home to a host of international scholars, well-patronized by the Ptolemaic dynasty with travel, lodging, and stipends for their whole families.   [ 6 ]    \n According to Galen, Ptolemy III requested permission from the Athenians to borrow the original scripts of  Aeschylus ,  Sophocles  and  Euripides , for which the Athenians demanded the enormous amount of fifteen  talents  (450\u00a0kg) of a precious metal as guarantee. Ptolemy III happily paid the fee but kept the original scripts for the library.   [ 15 ]    This story may also be construed erroneously to show the power of Alexandria over Athens during the  Ptolemaic dynasty . This detail is due to the fact that Alexandria was a man-made bidirectional port between the mainland and the  Pharos  island, welcoming trade from the East and West, and soon found itself to be an international hub for trade, the leading producer of papyrus and, soon enough, books.   [ 16 ]    \n The editors at the Library of Alexandria are especially well known for their work on  Homeric  texts. The more famous editors generally also held the title of  head librarian . These included  Zenodotus ,  Apollonius of Rhodes ,  Eratosthenes ,  Aristophanes of Byzantium , and  Aristarchus of Samothrace , among others.   [ 17 ]    (While  Callimachus \u2014the first bibliographer and developer of the \" Pinakes \", popularly considered to be the first library catalog\u2014did his most famous work at the Library of Alexandria, he was never the head librarian there.   [ 18 ]   ) In the early 2nd century BCE scholars began to abandon Alexandria for safer areas with more generous patronage, and in 145 BCE Ptolemy VIII expelled all foreign scholars from Alexandria.   [ 19 ]    \n  Destruction   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Destruction of the Library of Alexandria  \n \n    \n \n     \n The Burning of the Library at Alexandria in 391 AD , an illustration from 'Hutchinsons History of the Nations', c. 1910 \n \n \n The famous burning of the Library of Alexandria, including the incalculable loss of ancient works, has become a symbol of the irretrievable loss of public knowledge. Although there is a mythology of \" the  burning of the Library at Alexandria\", the library may have suffered several fires or acts of destruction of varying degrees over many years. Ancient and modern sources identify several possible occasions for the partial or complete destruction of the Library of Alexandria.   [ 20 ]    \n During  Caesar's Civil War ,  Julius Caesar  was  besieged at Alexandria  in 48 BCE. Many ancient sources describe Caesar setting fire to his own ships   [ 21 ]      [ 22 ]    and state that this fire spread to the library, destroying it.   [ 23 ]    \n \n [W]hen the enemy endeavored to cut off his communication by sea, he was forced to divert that danger by setting fire to his own ships, which, after burning the docks, thence spread on and destroyed the great library. \n \u2014Plutarch,  Life of Caesar    [ 24 ]    \n \n Bolstering this claim, in the 4th century both the pagan historian Ammianus   [ 25 ]    and the Christian historian  Orosius  [   citation needed   ]  wrote that the Bibliotheca Alexandrina had been destroyed by Caesar's fire. However,  Florus  and  Lucan  claim that the flames Caesar set only burned the fleet and some \"houses near the sea\". Years after Caesar's campaign in Alexandria, the Greek geographer  Strabo  claimed to have worked in the Alexandrian Library. [   citation needed   ]  \n The library seems to have continued in existence to some degree until its contents were largely lost during the taking of the city by the Emperor  Aurelian  (270\u2013275), who was suppressing a revolt by  Queen Zenobia  of  Palmyra .   [ 26 ]    During the course of the fighting, the areas of the city in which the main library was located were damaged.   [ 11 ]    Some sources claim that the smaller library located at the Serapeum survived,   [ 27 ]    though  Ammianus Marcellinus  wrote of the library in the Serapeum temple as a thing of the past, destroyed when Caesar sacked Alexandria.   [ 28 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \n5th century scroll which illustrates the destruction of the Serapeum by Theophilus \n \n \n Paganism was made illegal by an edict of the Emperor  Theodosius I  in 391. The temples of Alexandria were closed by  Patriarch   Theophilus of Alexandria  in AD 391.   [ 27 ]    The historian  Socrates of Constantinople  describes that all pagan temples in Alexandria were destroyed, including the Serapeum.   [ 29 ]    Since the Serapeum housed a part of the Great Library, some scholars believe that the remains of the Library of Alexandria were destroyed at this time.   [ 27 ]      [ 30 ]    However, it is not known how many, if any, books were contained in it at the time of destruction, and contemporary scholars do not mention the library directly.   [ 31 ]      [ 32 ]    \n In 642 AD, Alexandria was  captured by the Muslim army  of  Amr ibn al `Aas . Several later Arabic sources describe the library's destruction by the order of  Caliph Omar .   [ 33 ]      [ 34 ]     Bar-Hebraeus , writing in the 13th century, quotes Omar as saying \"If those books are in agreement with the Quran, we have no need of them; and if these are opposed to the Quran, destroy them.\"   [ 35 ]    Later scholars are skeptical of these stories, given the range of time that had passed before they were written down and the political motivations of the various writers.   [ 36 ]      [ 37 ]      [ 38 ]      [ 39 ]      [ 40 ]    \n  Legacy   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n     \n  This section requires  expansion .   (August 2013)    \n \n \n Although the various component parts of the physical library were destroyed, in fact the centres of academic excellence had already moved to various capital cities. Furthermore, it is possible that most of the material from the Library of Alexandria actually survived, by way of the  Imperial Library of Constantinople , the  Academy of Gondishapur , and the  House of Wisdom . This material may then have been preserved by the  Reconquista , which led to the formation of  European Universities  and the  recompilation of ancient texts  from formerly scattered fragments.   [ 41 ]    \n  Modern day   [  edit  ]   \n In 2002, the  Bibliotheca Alexandrina  was inaugurated near the site of the ancient library, intended as a commemoration and emulation of the Royal Library of Alexandria. \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^     Manguel, Alberto, The Library at Night.

[ 1 ]    It refers to a multi-disciplined approach to achieving organisational objectives by making the best use of knowledge.   [ 2 ]    \n An established  discipline  since 1991 (see  Nonaka 1991 ), KM includes courses taught in the fields of  business administration ,  information systems , management, and library and  information sciences  ( Alavi &amp; Leidner 1999 ).   [ 3 ]      [ 4 ]    More recently, other fields have started contributing to KM research; these include information and media,  computer science ,  public health , and  public policy .   [ 5 ]     Columbia University  and  Kent State University  offer dedicated  Master of Science  degrees in Knowledge Management.   [ 6 ]      [ 7 ]    \n Many large companies and non-profit organisations have resources dedicated to internal KM efforts, often as a part of their  business strategy , information technology, or  human resource management  departments.   [ 8 ]    Several consulting companies provide strategy and advice regarding KM to these organisations.   [ 8 ]    \n Knowledge management efforts typically focus on organisational  objectives  such as improved performance,  competitive advantage , innovation, the sharing of lessons learned, integration and  continuous improvement  of the organisation.   [ 9 ]    KM efforts overlap with  organisational learning  and may be distinguished from that by a greater focus on the management of knowledge as a strategic asset and a focus on encouraging the sharing of knowledge.   [ 2 ]      [ 10 ]    It is seen as an enabler of organisational learning   [ 11 ]    and a more concrete mechanism than the previous abstract research.   [ 12 ]      [ 13 ]    \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   History   \n   2   Research  \n \n   2.1   Dimensions   \n   2.2   Strategies   \n   2.3   Motivations   \n   2.4   Technologies   \n \n \n   3   See also   \n   4   References   \n   5   External links   \n \n \n  \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n Knowledge management efforts have a long history, to include on-the-job discussions, formal apprenticeship,  discussion forums , corporate libraries, professional training and mentoring programs.   [ 2 ]      [ 12 ]    With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century, specific  adaptations  of technologies such as  knowledge bases ,  expert systems ,  knowledge repositories ,  group decision support systems ,  intranets , and  computer-supported cooperative work  have been introduced to further enhance such efforts.   [ 2 ]    \n In 1999, the term  personal knowledge management  was introduced; it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level.   [ 14 ]    \n In the enterprise, early collections of case studies recognized the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy, process, and measurement.   [ 15 ]      [ 16 ]    Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation, dissemination, and application; cognitive, social, and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy; and measurement, benchmarking, and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change.   [ 16 ]    In short, knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful, concrete, and action-oriented.   [ 16 ]    \n More recently with the advent of the  Web 2.0 , the concept of knowledge management has evolved toward a vision more based on people participation and  emergence .   [ 17 ]    This line of evolution is termed  Enterprise 2.0 .   [ 17 ]    However, there is an ongoing debate and discussions as to whether  Enterprise 2.0  is a fad that does not bring anything new or useful or whether it is, indeed, the future of knowledge management.   [ 18 ]      [ 19 ]    \n  Research   [  edit  ]   \n KM emerged as a scientific discipline in the earlier 1990s.   [ 20 ]    It was initially supported solely by practitioners, when  Skandia  hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first  Chief Knowledge Officer  (CKO).   [ 21 ]    Hubert Saint-Onge (formerly of  CIBC , Canada), started investigating KM long before that.   [ 2 ]    The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximize the intangible assets of their organisations.   [ 2 ]    Gradually, CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM, and the new research field was formed.   [ 22 ]    Discussion of the KM idea has been taken up by academics, such as  Ikujiro Nonaka  ( Hitotsubashi University ),  Hirotaka Takeuchi  (Hitotsubashi University),  Thomas H. Davenport  ( Babson College ) and Baruch Lev ( New York University ).   [ 3 ]      [ 19 ]    In 2001,  Thomas A. Stewart , former editor at   Fortune   magazine and subsequently the editor of   Harvard Business Review  , published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organisations.   [ 23 ]    Since its establishment, the KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity.   [ 2 ]    First, there is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics; particularly, there has been a drop in single-authored publications. Second, the role of practitioners has changed.   [ 22 ]    Their contribution to academic research has been dramatically declining from 30% of overall contributions up to 2002, to only 10% by 2009 ( Serenko et al. 2010 ).   [ 24 ]    \n A broad range of thoughts on the KM discipline exist; approaches vary by author and school.   [ 22 ]      [ 25 ]    As the discipline matures, academic debates have increased regarding both the  theory  and practice of KM, to include the following perspectives: \n \n  Techno-centric  with a focus on technology, ideally those that enhance  knowledge sharing  and creation.   [ 26 ]      [ 27 ]    \n  Organisational  with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best.   [ 8 ]    \n   Ecological   with a focus on the interaction of people,  identity , knowledge, and environmental factors as a  complex adaptive system  akin to a natural  ecosystem .   [ 28 ]      [ 29 ]    \n \n Regardless of the  school of thought , core components of KM include people, processes, technology (or) culture, structure, technology, depending on the specific  perspective  ( Spender &amp; Scherer 2007 ). Different KM schools of thought include  lenses  through which KM can be viewed and explained, to include: \n \n  community of practice     [ 30 ]    \n  social network analysis    [ 31 ]    \n intellectual capital ( Bontis &amp; Choo 2002 ) \n  information theory  ( McInerney 2002 )   [ 21 ]    \n  complexity science    [ 32 ]    \n constructivism( Nanjappa &amp; Grant 2003 )   [ 33 ]    \n \n The practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned ( Ferguson 2005 ) with  action research  suggested as having more relevance ( Andriessen 2004 ) and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice ( Booker, Bontis &amp; Serenko 2008 ).   [ 15 ]      [ 15 ]      [ 34 ]      [ 35 ]    \n  Dimensions   [  edit  ]   \n Different  frameworks  for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist.   [ 12 ]    One proposed framework for categorizing the  dimensions  of knowledge distinguishes between  tacit knowledge  and  explicit knowledge .   [ 32 ]    Tacit knowledge represents internalized knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as how he or she accomplishes particular tasks. At the opposite end of the spectrum, explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that can easily be communicated to others. ( Alavi &amp; Leidner 2001 ).   [ 22 ]    Similarly, Hayes and Walsham (2003) describe content and relational perspectives of knowledge and knowledge management as two fundamentally different epistemological perspectives.   [ 36 ]    The content perspective suggest that knowledge is easily stored because it may be codified, while the relational perspective recognizes the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside of the specific location where the knowledge is developed.   [ 36 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \nThe Knowledge Spiral as described by Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi. \n \n \n Early research suggested that a successful KM effort needs to convert internalized tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it, and the same effort must permit individuals to internalize and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort.   [ 8 ]      [ 37 ]    Subsequent research into KM suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory.   [ 14 ]    Specifically, for knowledge to be made explicit, it must be translated into information (i.e.,  symbols  outside of our heads) ( Serenko &amp; Bontis 2004 ).   [ 14 ]    Later on, Ikujiro Nonaka proposed a model (SECI for Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) which considers a spiraling knowledge process interaction between  explicit knowledge  and tacit knowledge ( Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi 1995 ).   [ 38 ]    In this model, knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is 're-internalized' into implicit knowledge.   [ 38 ]    More recently, together with Georg von Krogh, Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forwards ( Nonaka &amp; von Krogh 2009 ).   [ 4 ]    \n A second proposed framework for categorizing the dimensions of knowledge distinguishes between embedded knowledge of a  system  outside of a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) and embodied knowledge representing a learned capability of a human body\u2019s  nervous  and  endocrine systems  ( Sensky 2002 ).   [ 39 ]    \n A third proposed framework for categorizing the dimensions of knowledge distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \"new knowledge\" (i.e., innovation) vs. the  transfer  or exploitation of \"established knowledge\" within a group, organisation, or community.   [ 36 ]      [ 40 ]    Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of  social computing  tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer.   [ 40 ]    \n  Strategies   [  edit  ]   \n Knowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities.   [ 41 ]    Organisations have tried knowledge capture  incentives , including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into  performance measurement  plans.   [ 42 ]    Considerable controversy exists over whether incentives work or not in this field and no consensus has emerged.   [ 9 ]    \n One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy).   [ 9 ]      [ 43 ]    In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a  database , as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided to the repository.   [ 43 ]    This is commonly known as the Codification approach to KM.   [ 43 ]    \n Another strategy to KM involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy).   [ 9 ]      [ 43 ]    In such an instance, expert individual(s) can provide their  insights  to the particular person or people needing this ( Snowden 2002 ).   [ 32 ]    This is commonly known as the Personalisation approach to KM. \n Hansen et al. propose a simple framework, distinguishing two opposing KM strategies: codification and personalization.   [ 44 ]    Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in previously designed electronic databases to make it accessible to the organisation.   [ 45 ]    Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge.   [ 46 ]    In contrast, the personalization strategy aims at encouraging individuals to share their knowledge directly.   [ 45 ]    Information technology plays a less important role, as it is only supposed to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among members of an organisation. \n Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include:   [ 9 ]      [ 28 ]      [ 32 ]    \n \n Rewards (as a means of motivating for knowledge sharing) \n  Storytelling  (as a means of transferring tacit knowledge) \n Cross-project learning \n  After action reviews  \n Knowledge mapping (a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible by all) \n  Communities of practice  \n Expert directories (to enable knowledge seeker to reach to the experts) \n Best practice transfer \n Knowledge fairs \n Competence management (systematic evaluation and planning of competences of individual organisation members) \n Proximity &amp; architecture (the physical situation of employees can be either conducive or obstructive to knowledge sharing) \n Master-apprentice relationship \n Collaborative technologies ( groupware , etc.) \n Knowledge repositories (databases,  bookmarking engines , etc.) \n Measuring and reporting intellectual capital (a way of making explicit knowledge for companies) \n  Knowledge brokers  (some organisational members take on responsibility for a specific \"field\" and act as first reference on whom to talk about a specific subject) \n  Social software  (wikis, social bookmarking, blogs, etc.) \n Inter-project knowledge transfer \n \n  Motivations   [  edit  ]   \n There are a number of claims as to the  motivations  leading organisations to undertake a KM effort.   [ 47 ]    Typical considerations driving a KM effort include:   [ 32 ]    \n \n Making available increased knowledge content in the  development  and provision of  products  and  services  \n Achieving shorter  new product development  cycles \n Facilitating and managing innovation and organisational learning \n Leveraging the  expertise  of people across the organisation \n Increasing  network   connectivity  between internal and external individuals \n Managing business environments and allowing employees to obtain relevant insights and  ideas  appropriate to their work \n Solving intractable or  wicked problems  \n Managing intellectual capital and intellectual assets in the workforce (such as the expertise and  know-how  possessed by key individuals) \n \n Debate exists whether KM is more than a passing  fad , though increasing amount of research in this field may help to answer this question, as well as create consensus on what elements of KM help determine the success or failure of such efforts ( Wilson 2002 ).   [ 48 ]     Knowledge sharing  remains a challenging issue for knowledge management, while there is no clear agreement barriers may include time issues for knowledge works, the level of trust, lack of effective support technologies and culture ( Jennex 2008 ).   [ 49 ]    \n  Technologies   [  edit  ]   \n Early KM technologies included  online  corporate  yellow pages  as expertise locators and  document management systems .   [ 26 ]    Combined with the early development of collaborative technologies (in particular  Lotus Notes ), KM technologies expanded in the mid-1990s.   [ 26 ]    Subsequent KM efforts leveraged  semantic  technologies for  search  and retrieval and the development of  e-learning  tools for  communities of practice  ( Capozzi 2007 ).   [ 50 ]    Knowledge management systems can thus be categorized as falling into one or more of the following groups: Groupware, document management systems, expert systems, semantic networks, relational and object oriented databases, simulation tools, and  artificial intelligence    [ 9 ]    \n More recently, development of social computing tools (such as  bookmarks , blogs, and  wikis ) have allowed more unstructured, self-governing or ecosystem approaches to the transfer, capture and creation of knowledge, including the development of new forms of communities,  networks , or  matrixed organisations .   [ 35 ]      [ 51 ]    However such tools for the most part are still based on text and  code , and thus represent explicit knowledge transfer.   [ 52 ]    These tools face challenges in distilling meaningful re-usable knowledge and ensuring that their content is transmissible through diverse  channels ( Andrus 2005 ).   [ 5 ]    \n Software tools in knowledge management are a collection of technologies and are not necessarily acquired as a single software solution.   [ 50 ]      [ 53 ]    Furthermore, these  knowledge management software  tools have the advantage of using the organisation's existing information technology infrastructure.   [ 20 ]    Organisations and business decision makers spend a great deal of resources and make significant investments in the latest technology, systems and infrastructure to support knowledge management.   [ 54 ]    It is imperative that these investments are validated properly, made wisely and that the most appropriate technologies and software tools are selected or combined to facilitate knowledge management.   [ 34 ]    \n Knowledge management has become a cornerstone in emerging  business strategies  such as Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) with companies increasingly turning to software vendors to enhance their efficiency in industries including, but not limited to, the aviation industry. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n  Knowledge community  \n  Knowledge ecosystem  \n  Knowledge engineering  \n  Knowledge management software  \n  Knowledge transfer  \n  Knowledge Cafe  \n  Ignorance management  \n  Legal case management  \n  Knowledge modeling  \n \n Journals: \n \n  Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management  \n  Journal of Knowledge Management  \n  Journal of Knowledge Management Practice  \n \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n    ^      Davenport, Thomas H.

(November 2008)    \n \n \n See also  Knowledge organization  (in Library and Information Science). \n A  knowledge organization  is a management idea, describing an organization in which people use systems and processes to generate, transform, manage, use, and transfer knowledge-based products and services to achieve organizational goals. A knowledge organization also links past, present, and future by capturing and preserving knowledge in the past, sharing and mobilizing knowledge today, and gKnowledge organizations can be viewed from a number of perspectives: their general nature, networks, behavior, human dimensions, communications, intelligence, functions, and services. \n  Nature of Knowledge Organizations   [  edit  ]   \n Drucker (1974) may have been the first to describe knowledge workers and knowledge work. \n Savage (1990)[4] observed that the nature of an organization based on knowledge rather than industrial society notions of land, labor, or capital was not well understood. Mcgee and Prusak (1993)[5] noted that core competencies are not what an organization owns, but rather what it knows. \n Knowledge organizations have a network dimension. Davis (1977)[6] states that networks would not replace hierarchies, but that the two would coexist within a broader organizational concept. Similarly, Amidon (1997)[7] points out that traditional industrial-era hierarchies are neither flexible nor fluid enough to mobilize an organization's intellectual capacity and that much less constrained networked organizational forms are needed for modern decision making. Tapscott (1998)[8] notes that there is an underlying logic and order to the emerging digital organizational form. It is networked, involves multiple enterprises, is based on core competencies, and knowledge is actively created, exchanged, and used. \n There is also a behavioral approach. Bartlett (1999)[9] indicates that organizational structure is just a skeleton. Knowledge organizations also have a physiology in the form of the flow of information and knowledge, as life-blood. They also have a psychology represented by people's values and how they act as individuals and collectively. \n Knowledge is created and used by people. Strassman (1985) described the transformation of work in the electronic age from the standpoint of education and training for managers and employees, human aspects of the working environment, and issues of morale, motivation, privacy, and displacements. Bartlett (1999)[9] indicates that empowerment is not possible in an autocratic organization, that networks cannot be sustained in fixed hierarchical structure, and that learning is not possible in an environment constrained by rigid policies and procedures. Davenport (1997) used an information ecology approach, in which he explored the use and  abuse of information  in the context of infighting, resource hoarding, and political battles as well as appropriate management in such a context. \n Simard (2000) [10] states that knowledge is inextricably linked to organizational mandates. Some providers strive for objectivity, others selectively disseminate information and knowledge, while still others use information to further their agenda. Users must understand that information is not innocent, and that all information is not created equal. \n Knowledge organizations also have collective intelligence. Liautaut (2001)[11] points out that in the knowledge economy, being an intelligent business is not only a prerequisite to winning, but even to compete in the first place. In a fluid, fast-paced knowledge market, companies that can find and exploit the slightest advantage for faster, better decision making will dominate. He also indicates that the greater the exchange of data and information across an organization, the more intelligent it will be. \n From a functional perspective, in a knowledge organization, content (objects, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom) are generated by knowledge workers. Content is captured, organized, and preserved to enable its reuse and leveraging by people and groups other than those who generated it. Infrastructure is in place to enable sharing of content across all elements of an organization and with external partners, as appropriate. Procedures are in place to integrate content from multiple sources and mobilize it to achieve organizational goals and objectives. A learning culture promotes not only individual learning but also results in a shared understanding. Finally, the organization embraces continuous evolutionary change to sustain itself in a constantly changing environment. \n Simard et al. (2007) [12] described five functions of a knowledge-service organization: \n generate content transform content into useful products and services preserve and manage content to enable organizational use and external transfer use content to achieve organizational goals, and transfer content externally, in the form of products and services. Functions 1, 3, and 5 are essential and cannot be bypassed. \n The knowledge in organizations is more complicated. Except from formal and informal documents, Davenport &amp; Prusak\u2019s (1998) also introduced routines, processes, practices and norms. It may therefore be clear that organizational knowledge is much more than a sum of all the individual knowledge (see Bhatt, 2000a). In a survey conducted by Cranfield University (1998) it became clear that most of the knowledge an organization needs, already exists in the organization, but that finding and identifying it were the problems (see also Hinds &amp;Pfeffer, 2001). This has several explanations. \n First of all it depends how the knowledge in an organization is organized. Hansen et al. (1999) made a distinction between a codification and personalization strategy. A codification strategy focuses as the word already implicates, to codify knowledge in a company, where a personalization strategy implies personal interaction as the main factor for exchanging knowledge. Both strategies have their problems. First of all it is in many cases not possible to codify knowledge because of e.g. codifiability and complexity (see Kogut and Zander, 1992 for a very clear and elaborated study on this subject). This is called cognitive limitations (Hinds &amp; Pfeffer, 2001). Hinds &amp; Pfeffer (2001, pp4) argue that\u00a0: \n \"As expertise increases, mental representations become more abstract and simplified\" And even if people can share knowledge, sometimes they do not want to. Hinds &amp; Pfeffer (2001) call this motivational limitations. Hall et al. (2001) see rewards and informal activities with colleagues as the solution for the so-called motivational limitations. They divided the rewards in two groups, the explicit and the soft rewards. Explicit rewards are e.g. economic incentives and career advancement. Soft rewards are non-economic rewards such as reputation and satisfaction. \n All this theory is based on formal structures in an organization. Organizations all also exist out informal ties and networks. This complicates organizational goals of formal knowledge sharing. A company will lose track of who has what knowledge because of the informal networks. This does not mean that informal networks are negative, just on the contrary, informal networks can create ties and surroundings which are necessary for knowledge sharing (see Brown &amp; Deguid, 2001). Informal networks have received different names in the literature such as sensemaking (Weick, 1979), communities of practice (Brown &amp; Deguid 1998) and communities of knowing (Boland &amp;Tenkasi, 1995), Nikolai Groups (Nikolaivitch 1956). As Pan &amp; Leidner (2003) argue in their paper, communities of practice exist because functional boundaries do not fit the community boundaries. They state (pp 73): \u201cfacilitate an environment of 'structured informality' supported by knowledge, people, organizational processes and infrastructure.\u201d \n The implication and unfortunately also the complication of informal networks is that an organization loose the general view of the knowledge in the organization. As showed by Cross et al. (2001) an informal structure significantly differs of the formal one. To effectively maximize the potential the authors argue that it is necessary to analyze both structures. They introduce the so-called Social Network analysis which systematically assesses informal networks. The result is that knowledge consequently can be collected from formal and informal networks to create a socio-knowledge matrix in organizations. \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n Digital Economy Information economy Information Market Information Society Internet Economy Knowledge market Knowledge policy Knowledge Revolution Knowledge services Knowledge workers Knowledge Value Network Economy Personal information management \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n ^ Hoetzlein R., 2007.

Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a  mathematical science  with specialized knowledge. The term \"applied mathematics\" also describes the  professional  specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems,  applied mathematics  focuses on the formulation and study of mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in  pure mathematics , where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   History   \n   2   Divisions   \n   3   Utility   \n   4   Status in academic departments   \n   5   Other associated mathematical sciences  \n \n   5.1   Scientific computing   \n   5.2   Computer science   \n   5.3   Operations research and management science   \n   5.4   Statistics   \n   5.5   Actuarial science   \n   5.6   Economics   \n   5.7   Other disciplines   \n \n \n   6   See also   \n   7   References   \n   8   External links   \n \n \n  \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nA numerical solution to the  heat equation  on a pump casing  model  using the  finite element method . \n \n \n Historically, applied mathematics consisted principally of  applied analysis , most notably  differential equations ;  approximation theory  (broadly construed, to include  representations ,  asymptotic  methods,  variational methods , and  numerical analysis ); and applied  probability . These areas of mathematics were intimately tied to the development of  Newtonian physics , and in fact, the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century. This history left a legacy as well: until the early 20th century, subjects such as  classical mechanics  were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in  physics  departments, and  fluid mechanics  may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.   [ 1 ]     Engineering  and  computer science  departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics. \n  Divisions   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Fluid mechanics  is often considered a branch of applied mathematics. \n \n \n Today, the term \"applied mathematics\" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as  number theory  that are part of  pure mathematics  are now important in applications (such as  cryptography ), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics  per se . Sometimes, the term \"applicable mathematics\" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today. \n There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are. Such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time, and also by the way universities organize departments, courses, and degrees. \n Many mathematicians distinguish between \"applied mathematics,\" which is concerned with mathematical methods, and the \"applications of mathematics\" within science and engineering. A  biologist  using a  population model  and applying known mathematics would not be  doing  applied mathematics, but rather  using  it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics. Mathematicians such as  Poincar\u00e9  and  Arnold  deny the existence of \"applied mathematics\" and claim that there are only \"applications of mathematics.\" Similarly, non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics. The use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called \"industrial mathematics\".   [ 2 ]    \n The success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of  computational mathematics ,  computational science , and  computational engineering , which use  high-performance computing  for the  simulation  of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary disciplines. \n  Utility   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \n Mathematical finance  is concerned with the modelling of financial markets. \n \n \n Historically, mathematics was most important in the  natural sciences  and  engineering . However, since  World War II , fields outside of the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics, such as  game theory  and  social choice theory , which grew out of economic considerations, or  neural networks , which arose out of the study of the brain in  neuroscience . \n The advent of the computer has created new applications: studying and using the new computer technology itself ( computer science ) to study problems arising in other areas of science ( computational science ) as well as the mathematics of computation (for example,  theoretical computer science ,  computer algebra ,  numerical analysis ).  Statistics  is probably the most widespread  mathematical science  used in the  social sciences , but other areas of mathematics, most notably  economics , are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines. \n  Status in academic departments   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n     \n \n  This section  does not  cite  any  references or sources  .

(February 2008)    \n \n \n Academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses, programs, and degrees in applied mathematics. At some schools, there is a single mathematics department, whereas others have separate departments for Applied Mathematics and (Pure) Mathematics. It is very common for Statistics departments to be separate at schools with graduate programs, but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department. \n Many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications. Some Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside of mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application. In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between \"application of mathematics\" and \"applied mathematics\". \n Some universities in the  UK  host departments of  Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ,   [ 3 ]    but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics. A notable exception to this is the  Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics  at the  University of Cambridge , housing the  Lucasian Professor of Mathematics  whose past holders include  Isaac Newton ,  Charles Babbage ,  James Lighthill ,  Paul Dirac  and  Stephen Hawking . \n Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from  Brown University , which has a well-known and large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the  doctorate , to  Santa Clara University , which offers only the  M.S.  in applied mathematics.   [ 4 ]    Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include  Harvard  and  MIT . \n  Other associated mathematical sciences   [  edit  ]   \n \n    \n \n     \nApplied mathematics has substantial overlap with  statistics . \n \n \n Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences. \n  Scientific computing   [  edit  ]   \n  Scientific computing  includes applied mathematics (especially  numerical analysis ),  computing science  (especially  high-performance computing ), and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline. \n  Computer science   [  edit  ]   \n  Computer science  relies on  logic ,  algebra , and  combinatorics . \n  Operations research and management science   [  edit  ]   \n  Operations research  and  management science  are often taught in faculties of engineering, business, and public policy. \n  Statistics   [  edit  ]   \n Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of  statistics .  Statistical theorists  study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on  probability  and  decision theory , and makes extensive use of  scientific computing ,  analysis , and  optimization ; for the  design of experiments , statisticians use  algebra  and  combinatorial design . Applied mathematicians and  statisticians  often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities). \n  Actuarial science   [  edit  ]   \n  Actuarial science  uses  probability ,  statistics , and  economic theory . \n  Economics   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Mathematical economics  \n Mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economic theory. By convention, the applied methods usually refer to nontrivial mathematical techniques or approaches. Mathematical economics is based on statistics &amp; probability, mathematical programming (as well as other  computational methods ), operations research, game theory, and some methods from mathematical analysis. In this regard, it resembles (but is distinct from)  financial mathematics , another part of applied mathematics. \n According to the  Mathematics Subject Classification  (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the  Applied mathematics/other  classification of category 91: \n \n Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences \n \n with  MSC2010  classifications for ' Game theory ' at codes  91Axx  and for ' Mathematical economics ' at codes  91Bxx . A detailed discussion about subject classifications within this subfield can be found  here . \n Mathematical methods as delineated in related economics texts include the texts found at the  following reading list . \n  Other disciplines   [  edit  ]   \n The line between applied mathematics and specific areas of application is often blurred. Many universities teach mathematical and statistical courses outside of the respective departments, in departments and areas including  business ,  engineering ,  physics ,  chemistry ,  psychology ,  biology ,  computer science ,  scientific computation , and  mathematical physics . \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n     \n  Mathematics portal  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  Book: Applied science  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Pure mathematics  \n  Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  \n \n   \n  References   [  edit  ]   \n \n    ^      Stolz, M.

This field first became an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric  telegraph , the  telephone , and  electric power  distribution and use. It now covers a wide range of subfields including  electronics ,  digital computers ,  power engineering ,  telecommunications ,  control systems ,  RF engineering , and  signal processing . \n Electrical engineering may include  electronic engineering . Where a distinction is made, usually outside of the United States, electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with systems such as  electric power transmission  and  electrical machines , whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of electronic systems including  computers ,  communication systems ,  integrated circuits , and  radar .   [ 1 ]    \n From a different point-of-view, electrical engineers are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit  electric power , while electronic engineers are concerned with using electricity to process information. The subdisciplines can overlap, for example, in the growth of  power electronics , and the study of behavior of large electrical grids under the control of digital computers and electronics. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   History  \n \n   1.1   19th century   \n   1.2   More modern developments   \n   1.3   A complete breakthrough in electronics - solid-state transistors   \n \n \n   2   Education   \n   3   Practicing engineers   \n   4   Tools and work   \n   5   Subdisciplines  \n \n   5.1   Power   \n   5.2   Control   \n   5.3   Electronics   \n   5.4   Microelectronics   \n   5.5   Signal processing   \n   5.6   Telecommunications   \n   5.7   Instrumentation   \n   5.8   Computers   \n \n \n   6   Related disciplines   \n   7   See also   \n   8   Notes   \n   9   References   \n   10   External links   \n \n \n  \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  History of electrical engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \nThe discoveries of  Michael Faraday  formed the foundation of electric motor technology. \n \n \n  Electricity  has been a subject of scientific interest since at least the early 17th century. The first electrical engineer was probably  William Gilbert  who designed the  versorium : a device that detected the presence of statically charged objects. He was also the first to draw a clear distinction between magnetism and static electricity and is credited with establishing the term electricity.   [ 2 ]    In 1775  Alessandro Volta 's scientific experimentations devised the  electrophorus , a device that produced a static electric charge, and by 1800 Volta developed the  voltaic pile , a forerunner of the electric battery.   [ 3 ]    \n  19th century   [  edit  ]   \n However, it was not until the 19th century that research into the subject started to intensify. Notable developments in this century include the work of  Georg Ohm , who in 1827 quantified the relationship between the  electric current  and  potential difference  in a  conductor ,  Michael Faraday , the discoverer of  electromagnetic induction  in 1831, and  James Clerk Maxwell , who in 1873 published a unified  theory  of electricity and  magnetism  in his treatise  Electricity and Magnetism .   [ 4 ]    \n Beginning in the 1830s, efforts were made to apply electricity to practical use in the  telegraph . By the end of the 19th century the world had been forever changed by the rapid communication made possible by engineering development of land-lines,  submarine cables , and, from about 1890,  wireless telegraphy . \n Practical applications and advances in such fields created an increasing need for standardized units of measure. They led to the international standardization of the units  volt ,  ampere ,  coulomb ,  ohm ,  farad , and  henry . This was achieved at an international conference in Chicago 1893.   [ 5 ]    The publication of these standards formed the basis of future advances in standardisation in various industries, and in many countries the definitions were immediately recognised in relevant legislation.   [ 6 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \n Thomas Edison  built the world's first large-scale electrical supply network. \n \n \n During these years, the study of electricity was largely considered to be a subfield of  physics . It was not until about 1885 that  universities  and  institutes of technology  such as  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT) and  Cornell University  started to offer  bachelor's degrees  in electrical engineering. The  Darmstadt University of Technology  founded the first department of electrical engineering in the world in 1882. In that same year, under Professor Charles Cross at MIT began offering the first option of electrical engineering within its  physics  department.   [ 7 ]    In 1883,  Darmstadt University of Technology  and Cornell University introduced the world's first bachelor's degree courses of study in electrical engineering, and in 1885 the  University College London  founded the first chair of electrical engineering in  Great Britain .   [ 8 ]    The  University of Missouri  established the first department of electrical engineering in the United States in 1886.   [ 9 ]    Several other schools soon followed suit, including Cornell and the  Georgia School of Technology  in  Atlanta, Georgia . \n \n    \n \n     \n Nikola Tesla  developed  transformers  and  induction motors  for use in AC \n \n \n During these decades use of electrical engineering increased dramatically. In 1882,  Thomas Edison  switched on the world's first large-scale electric power network that provided 110 volts \u2014  direct current  (DC) \u2014 to 59 customers on  Manhattan Island  in  New York City . In 1884,  Sir Charles Parsons  invented the  steam turbine . Turbines now provide the mechanical power for about 80 percent of the electric power in the world using a variety of heat sources. The  alternating current  power system developed rapidly after 1886, and included the design of an  induction motor  by  Nikola Tesla  (licensed to George Westinghouse) and the theoretical work of  Charles Proteus Steinmetz . AC systems ability to transmit power over long distances overcame this limitation in direct current systems. \n The late 1880s saw a rivalry in systems for  electric power  distribution between alternating current and direct current, setting off what has been called the   War of Currents  .   [ 10 ]    The method of AC won over DC for generation and power distribution because of its superior technology, especially the use of  transformers  to increase and decrease voltages (not possible with DC). The use of high-voltage AC vastly extended the range of electric power distribution, and the use of transfomers improved both the efficiency and the safety of electric power distribution. \n  More modern developments   [  edit  ]   \n During the  development of radio , many scientists and  inventors  contributed to  radio technology  and electronics. In his classic physics experiments of 1888,  Heinrich Hertz  transmitted  radio waves  with a  spark-gap transmitter , and detected them by using simple electrical devices. The mathematical work of  James Clerk Maxwell  during the 1850s had shown the possibility of radio waves but  Heinrich Hertz  was the first to demonstrate their existence in 1888. \n \n    \n \n     \nGuglielmo Marconi known for his pioneering work on long distance radio transmission \n \n \n In 1897,  Karl Ferdinand Braun  introduced the  cathode ray tube  as part of an  oscilloscope , a crucial enabling technology for  electronic television .   [ 11 ]     John Fleming  invented the first radio tube, the  diode , in 1904. Two years later,  Robert von Lieben  and  Lee De Forest  independently developed the amplifier tube, called the  triode .   [ 12 ]    In 1895,  Guglielmo Marconi  furthered the art of hertzian wireless methods. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 2,100 miles (3,400\u00a0km).   [ 13 ]    In 1920  Albert Hull  developed the  magnetron  which would eventually lead to the development of the  microwave oven  in 1946 by  Percy Spencer .   [ 14 ]      [ 15 ]    In 1934 the British military began to make strides toward  radar  (which also uses the magnetron) under the direction of Dr Wimperis, culminating in the operation of the first radar station at  Bawdsey  in August 1936.   [ 16 ]    \n In 1941  Konrad Zuse  presented the  Z3 , the world's first fully functional and programmable computer using electromechanical parts. In 1943  Tommy Flowers  designed and built the  Colossus , the world's first fully functional, electronic, digital and programmable computer.   [ 17 ]    In 1946 the  ENIAC  (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) of  John Presper Eckert  and  John Mauchly  followed, beginning the computing era. The arithmetic performance of these machines allowed engineers to develop completely new technologies and achieve new objectives, including the  Apollo program  which culminated in  landing astronauts on the Moon .   [ 18 ]    \n  A complete breakthrough in electronics - solid-state transistors   [  edit  ]   \n The invention of the  transistor  in late 1947 by  William B. Shockley ,  John Bardeen , and  Walter Brattain  of the  Bell Telephone Laboratories  opened the door for more compact devices and led to the development of the  integrated circuit  in 1958 by  Jack Kilby  and independently in 1959 by  Robert Noyce .   [ 19 ]    Starting in 1968,  Ted Hoff  and a team at the  Intel Corporation  invented the first commercial  microprocessor , which foreshadowed the  personal computer . The  Intel 4004  was a four-bit processor released in 1971, but in 1973 the  Intel 8080 , an eight-bit processor, made the first personal computer, the  Altair 8800 , possible.   [ 20 ]    \n  Education   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Education and training of electrical and electronics engineers  \n Electrical engineers typically possess an  academic degree  with a major in  electrical engineering ,   electronics engineering  , or  electrical and electronic engineering . The same fundamental principles are taught in all programs, though emphasis may vary according to title. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a  Bachelor of Engineering ,  Bachelor of Science ,  Bachelor of Technology , or  Bachelor of Applied Science  depending on the university. The  bachelor's degree  generally includes units covering  physics ,  mathematics ,  computer science ,  project management , and a  variety of topics in electrical engineering . Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of electrical engineering. At some schools, the students can then choose to emphasize one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their courses of study. At many schools, electronic engineering is included as part of an electrical award, sometimes explicitly, such as a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic), but in others electrical and electronic engineering are both considered to be sufficiently broad and complex that separate degrees are offered.   [ 21 ]    \n Some electrical engineers choose to study for a postgraduate degree such as a  Master of Engineering / Master of Science  (M.Eng./M.Sc.), a Master of  Engineering Management , a  Doctor of Philosophy  (Ph.D.) in Engineering, an  Engineering Doctorate  (Eng.D.), or an  Engineer's degree . The master's and engineer's degrees may consist of either  research ,  coursework  or a mixture of the two. The Doctor of Philosophy and Engineering Doctorate degrees consist of a significant research component and are often viewed as the entry point to  academia . In the United Kingdom and some other European countries, Master of Engineering is often considered to be an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the Bachelor of Engineering rather than postgraduate.   [ 22 ]    \n  Practicing engineers   [  edit  ]   \n In most countries, a Bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards  professional certification  and the degree program itself is certified by a  professional body . After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of  Professional Engineer  (in the United States, Canada and South Africa ),  Chartered Engineer  or  Incorporated Engineer  (in India, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Ireland and  Zimbabwe ), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia and New Zealand) or  European Engineer  (in much of the  European Union ). \n The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada \"only a licensed engineer may seal engineering work for public and private clients\".   [ 23 ]    This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as  Quebec's  Engineers Act.   [ 24 ]    In other countries, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a  code of ethics  that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.   [ 25 ]    In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to  contract law . In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the  tort of negligence  and, in extreme cases, the charge of  criminal negligence . An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as  building codes  and legislation pertaining to  environmental law . \n Professional bodies of note for electrical engineers include the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE) and the  Institution of Engineering and Technology  (IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30% of the world's literature in electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 3,000 conferences annually.   [ 26 ]    The IET publishes 21 journals, has a worldwide membership of over 150,000, and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.   [ 27 ]      [ 28 ]    Obsolescence of technical skills is a serious concern for electrical engineers. Membership and participation in technical societies, regular reviews of periodicals in the field and a habit of continued learning are therefore essential to maintaining proficiency. MIET(Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology) is recognised in Europe as Electrical and computer (technology) engineer.   [ 29 ]    \n In Australia, Canada and the United States electrical engineers make up around 0.25% of the labor force (see   note  ). Outside of Europe and North America, engineering graduates per-capita, and hence probably electrical engineering graduates also, are most numerous in Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea.   [ 30 ]    \n  Tools and work   [  edit  ]   \n From the  Global Positioning System  to  electric power generation , electrical engineers have contributed to the development of a wide range of technologies. They design, develop, test and supervise the deployment of electrical systems and electronic devices. For example, they may work on the design of  telecommunication systems , the operation of  electric power stations , the  lighting  and  wiring  of  buildings , the design of  household appliances  or the electrical  control  of industrial machinery.   [ 31 ]    \n \n    \n \n     \n Satellite communications  is one of many projects an electrical engineer might work on. \n \n \n Fundamental to the discipline are the sciences of  physics  and  mathematics  as these help to obtain both a  qualitative  and  quantitative  description of how such systems will work. Today most  engineering  work involves the use of  computers  and it is commonplace to use  computer-aided design  programs when designing electrical systems. Nevertheless, the ability to sketch ideas is still invaluable for quickly communicating with others. \n Although most electrical engineers will understand basic  circuit theory  (that is the interactions of elements such as  resistors ,  capacitors ,  diodes ,  transistors  and  inductors  in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example,  quantum mechanics  and  solid state physics  might be relevant to an engineer working on  VLSI  (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even  circuit theory  may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use  off-the-shelf  components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for electrical engineers are reflected in university programs, which emphasize  strong numerical skills ,  computer literacy  and the ability to understand the  technical language and concepts  that relate to electrical engineering. \n For many engineers, technical work accounts for only a fraction of the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing  budgets  and determining  project schedules .   [ 32 ]    Many senior engineers manage a team of  technicians  or other engineers and for this reason  project management  skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and  strong written communication  skills are therefore very important. \n The  workplaces  of electrical engineers are just as varied as the types of work they do. Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a  fabrication plant , the offices of a  consulting firm  or on site at a  mine . During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including  scientists ,  electricians ,  computer programmers  and other engineers. \n  Subdisciplines   [  edit  ]   \n Electrical engineering has many subdisciplines, the most popular of which are listed below. Although there are electrical engineers who focus exclusively on one of these subdisciplines, many deal with a combination of them. Sometimes certain fields, such as electronic engineering and  computer engineering , are considered separate disciplines in their own right. \n  Power   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Power engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \n Power pole  \n \n \n Power engineering deals with the  generation ,  transmission  and  distribution  of  electricity  as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include  transformers ,  electric generators ,  electric motors , high voltage engineering, and  power electronics . In many regions of the world, governments maintain an electrical network called a  power grid  that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called  on-grid  power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called  off-grid  power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts. \n  Control   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Control engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \n Control systems  play a critical role in  space flight . \n \n \n  Control engineering  focuses on the  modeling  of a diverse range of  dynamic systems  and the design of  controllers  that will cause these systems to behave in the desired manner. To implement such controllers electrical engineers may use  electrical circuits ,  digital signal processors ,  microcontrollers  and  PLCs  (Programmable Logic Controllers).  Control engineering  has a wide range of applications from the flight and propulsion systems of  commercial airliners  to the  cruise control  present in many modern  automobiles . It also plays an important role in  industrial automation . \n Control engineers often utilize  feedback  when designing  control systems . For example, in an  automobile  with  cruise control  the vehicle's  speed  is continuously monitored and fed back to the system which adjusts the  motor's   power   output  accordingly. Where there is regular feedback,  control theory  can be used to determine how the system responds to such feedback. \n  Electronics   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Electronic engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \n Electronic components  \n \n \n Electronic engineering involves the design and testing of  electronic circuits  that use the properties of  components  such as  resistors ,  capacitors ,  inductors ,  diodes  and  transistors  to achieve a particular functionality. The  tuned circuit , which allows the user of a  radio  to  filter  out all but a single station, is just one example of such a circuit. Another example (of a pneumatic signal conditioner) is shown in the adjacent photograph. \n Prior to the second world war, the subject was commonly known as  radio engineering  and basically was restricted to aspects of communications and  radar ,  commercial radio  and  early television . Later, in post war years, as consumer devices began to be developed, the field grew to include modern television, audio systems,  computers  and  microprocessors . In the mid-to-late 1950s, the term  radio engineering  gradually gave way to the name  electronic engineering . \n Before the invention of the  integrated circuit  in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and  power  and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast,  integrated circuits  packed a large number\u2014often millions\u2014of tiny electrical components, mainly  transistors , into a small chip around the size of a  coin . This allowed for the powerful  computers  and other electronic devices we see today. \n  Microelectronics   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Microelectronics  \n \n    \n \n     \n Microprocessor  \n \n \n  Microelectronics  engineering deals with the design and  microfabrication  of very small electronic circuit components for use in an  integrated circuit  or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are  semiconductor   transistors , although all main electronic components ( resistors ,  capacitors  etc.)can be created at a microscopic level.  Nanoelectronics  is the further  scaling  of devices down to  nanometer  levels. Modern devices are already in the nanometer regime, with below 100\u00a0nm processing having been standard since about 2002. \n Microelectronic components are created by chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies,  compound semiconductors  like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves a significant amount of chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of  quantum mechanics . \n  Signal processing   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Signal processing  \n \n    \n \n     \nA  Bayer filter  on a  CCD  requires signal processing to get a red, green, and blue value at each pixel. \n \n \n  Signal processing  deals with the analysis and manipulation of  signals . Signals can be either  analog , in which case the signal varies continuously according to the information, or  digital , in which case the signal varies according to a series of discrete values representing the information. For analog signals, signal processing may involve the  amplification  and  filtering  of audio signals for audio equipment or the  modulation  and  demodulation  of signals for  telecommunications . For digital signals, signal processing may involve the  compression ,  error detection  and  error correction  of digitally sampled signals. \n Signal Processing is a very mathematically oriented and intensive area forming the core of  digital signal processing  and it is rapidly expanding with new applications in every field of electrical engineering such as communications, control, radar,  audio engineering ,  broadcast engineering , power electronics and bio-medical engineering as many already existing analog systems are replaced with their digital counterparts.  Analog signal processing  is still important in the design of many  control systems . \n DSP processor ICs are found in every type of modern electronic systems and products including,  SDTV  |  HDTV  sets, radios and mobile communication devices,  Hi-Fi  audio equipment,  Dolby   noise reduction  algorithms,  GSM  mobile phones,  mp3  multimedia players, camcorders and digital cameras, automobile control systems,  noise cancelling  headphones, digital  spectrum analyzers , intelligent missile guidance,  radar ,  GPS  based cruise control systems and all kinds of  image processing ,  video processing ,  audio processing  and  speech processing  systems. \n  Telecommunications   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Telecommunications engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \n Satellite dishes  are a crucial component in the analysis of satellite information. \n \n \n  Telecommunications engineering  focuses on the  transmission  of  information  across a  channel  such as a  coax cable ,  optical fiber  or  free space . Transmissions across free space require information to be encoded in a  carrier wave  to shift the information to a carrier frequency suitable for transmission, this is known as  modulation . Popular analog modulation techniques include  amplitude modulation  and  frequency modulation . The choice of modulation affects the cost and performance of a system and these two factors must be balanced carefully by the engineer. \n Once the transmission characteristics of a system are determined, telecommunication engineers design the  transmitters  and  receivers  needed for such systems. These two are sometimes combined to form a two-way communication device known as a  transceiver . A key consideration in the design of transmitters is their  power consumption  as this is closely related to their  signal strength . If the signal strength of a transmitter is insufficient the signal's information will be corrupted by  noise . \n  Instrumentation   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Instrumentation engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \n Flight instruments  provide pilots the tools to control aircraft analytically. \n \n \n  Instrumentation engineering  deals with the design of devices to measure physical quantities such as  pressure ,  flow  and  temperature . The design of such instrumentation requires a good understanding of  physics  that often extends beyond  electromagnetic theory . For example,  flight instruments  measure variables such as  wind speed  and  altitude  to enable pilots the control of aircraft analytically. Similarly,  thermocouples  use the  Peltier-Seebeck effect  to measure the temperature difference between two points. \n Often instrumentation is not used by itself, but instead as the  sensors  of larger electrical systems. For example, a thermocouple might be used to help ensure a furnace's temperature remains constant. For this reason, instrumentation engineering is often viewed as the counterpart of control engineering. \n  Computers   [  edit  ]   \n Main article:  Computer engineering  \n \n    \n \n     \n Supercomputers  are used in fields as diverse as  computational biology  and  geographic information systems . \n \n \n Computer engineering deals with the design of  computers  and  computer systems . This may involve the design of new  hardware , the design of  PDAs , tablets and  supercomputers  or the use of computers to control an  industrial plant . Computer engineers may also work on a system's  software . However, the design of complex software systems is often the domain of  software engineering , which is usually considered a separate discipline.  Desktop computers  represent a tiny fraction of the devices a computer engineer might work on, as computer-like architectures are now found in a range of devices including  video game consoles  and  DVD players . \n  Related disciplines   [  edit  ]   \n  Mechatronics  is an engineering discipline which deals with the convergence of electrical and  mechanical  systems. Such combined systems are known as  electromechanical  systems and have widespread adoption. Examples include  automated manufacturing systems ,  heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems  and various subsystems of  aircraft  and  automobiles . \n The term  mechatronics  is typically used to refer to  macroscopic  systems but  futurists  have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as  Microelectromechanical systems  (MEMS), are used in automobiles to tell  airbags  when to deploy, in  digital projectors  to create sharper images and in  inkjet printers  to create nozzles for high definition printing. In the future it is hoped the devices will help build tiny implantable medical devices and improve  optical communication .   [ 33 ]    \n  Biomedical engineering  is another related discipline, concerned with the design of  medical equipment . This includes fixed equipment such as  ventilators ,  MRI scanners  and  electrocardiograph monitors  as well as mobile equipment such as  cochlear implants ,  artificial pacemakers  and  artificial hearts . \n  See also   [  edit  ]   \n \n \n \n     \n  Electronics portal  \n \n \n     \n  Engineering portal  \n \n \n \n \n \n  Outline of electrical engineering  \n  Index of electrical engineering articles  \n  Electrical Technologist  \n  Electronic design automation  \n  International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC) \n  List of electrical engineers  \n  List of Russian electrical engineers  \n  Occupations in electrical/electronics engineering  \n  Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering  \n  List of mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment manufacturing companies by revenue  \n \n \n  Notes   [  edit  ]   \n   Note I   - There were around 300,000 people (as of 2006  [update]  ) working as electrical engineers in the US; in Australia, there were around 17,000 (as of 2008  [update]  ) and in Canada, there were around 37,000 (as of 2007  [update]  ), constituting about 0.2% of the labour force in each of the three countries. Australia and Canada reported that 96% and 88% of their electrical engineers respectively are male.

In  mathematics  and  empirical science , it is the act of  counting  and  measuring  that maps human sense  observations  and  experiences  into  members  of some  set  of  numbers . Quantification in this sense is fundamental to the  scientific method . \n In  logic ,  quantification  is the binding of a variable ranging over a  domain of discourse . The variable thereby becomes  bound  by an  operator  called a  quantifier . Academic discussion of quantification refers more often to this meaning of the term than the preceding one. \n In grammar, a  quantifier  is a type of  determiner , such as  all  or  many , that indicates quantity. These items have been argued to correspond to logical quantifiers at the semantic level. \n  \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n   1   Natural language   \n   2   Logic  \n \n   2.1   Mathematics   \n   2.2   Notation   \n   2.3   Equivalent expressions   \n   2.4   Nesting   \n   2.5   Range of quantification   \n   2.6   Formal semantics   \n   2.7   Paucal, multal and other degree quantifiers   \n   2.8   Other quantifiers   \n   2.9   History   \n \n \n   3   Natural science   \n   4   Social sciences   \n   5   Hard versus soft science   \n   6   See also   \n   7   References   \n   8   External links   \n \n \n  \n  Natural language   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  Number names  \n All known human languages make use of quantification (Wiese 2004). For example, in English: \n \n  Every  glass in my recent order was chipped. \n  Some of  the people standing across the river have white armbands. \n  Most of  the people I talked to didn't have a clue who the candidates were. \n  A lot of  people are smart. \n \n The words in italics are quantifiers. There exists no simple way of reformulating any one of these expressions as a conjunction or disjunction of sentences, each a simple predicate of an individual such as  That wine glass was chipped . These examples also suggest that the construction of quantified expressions in natural language can be syntactically very complicated. Fortunately, for mathematical assertions, the quantification process is syntactically more straightforward. \n The study of quantification in natural languages is much more difficult than the corresponding problem for formal languages. This comes in part from the fact that the grammatical structure of natural language sentences may conceal the logical structure. Moreover, mathematical conventions strictly specify the range of validity for formal language quantifiers; for natural language, specifying the range of validity requires dealing with non-trivial semantic problems. For example the sentence \u2033 Someone gets mugged in New York every 10 minutes \u2033 does not identify whether it is the same person getting mugged every 10 minutes. \n  Montague grammar  gives a novel formal semantics of natural languages. Its proponents argue that it provides a much more natural formal rendering of natural language than the traditional treatments of  Frege ,  Russell  and  Quine . \n  Logic   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  generalized quantifier \u00a0and  Lindstr\u00f6m quantifier  \n In  language  and  logic , quantification is a construct that specifies the quantity of specimens in the  domain of discourse  that apply to (or satisfy) an open formula. For example, in arithmetic, it allows the expression of the statement that every natural number has a successor. A language element which generates a quantification is called a quantifier. The resulting expression is a quantified expression; and the expression is said to be quantified over the predicate or function expression whose  free variable  is  bound  by the quantifier. Quantification is used in both  natural languages  and  formal languages . Examples of quantifiers in English are  for all ,  for some ,  many ,  few ,  a lot , and  no . In formal languages, quantification is a formula constructor that produces new formulas from old ones. The  semantics  of the language specifies how the constructor is interpreted as an extent of validity. \n The two fundamental kinds of quantification in  predicate logic  are  universal quantification  and  existential quantification . The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier \"all\" is \"\u2200\", an inverted letter \" A \", and for the  existential quantifier  \"exists\" is \"\u2203\", a rotated letter \" E \". These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of  Mostowski  and  Lindstr\u00f6m . \n  Mathematics   [  edit  ]   \n Consider the following statement: \n \n 1\u00b72 = 1 + 1, and 2\u00b72 = 2 + 2, and 3 \u00b7 2 = 3 + 3, ...., and  n  \u00b7 2 =  n  +  n , etc. \n \n This has the appearance of an  infinite  conjunction   of propositions. From the point of view of  formal languages  this is immediately a problem, since  syntax  rules are expected to generate  finite  objects. The example above is fortunate in that there is a  procedure  to generate all the conjuncts. However, if an assertion were to be made about every  irrational number , there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct formulation which avoids these problems uses  universal quantification : \n \n For any  natural number   n ,  n \u00b72 =  n  +  n . \n \n A similar analysis applies to the  disjunction , \n \n 1 is equal to 5 + 5, or 2 is equal to 5 + 5, or 3 is equal to 5 + 5, ... , or n is equal to 5 + 5, etc. \n \n which can be rephrased using  existential quantification : \n \n For some  natural number   n ,  n  is equal to 5 + 5. \n \n It is possible to devise  abstract algebras  whose  models  include  formal languages  with quantification, but progress has been slow and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date: \n \n  Relation algebra , invented by  De Morgan , and developed by  Charles Sanders Peirce ,  Ernst Schr\u00f6der ,  Tarski , and Tarski's students. Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep. Surprisingly, the  models  of relation algebra include the  axiomatic set theory   ZFC  and  Peano arithmetic ; \n  Cylindric algebra , devised by  Tarski ,  Henkin , and others; \n The  polyadic algebra  of  Paul Halmos . \n \n  Notation   [  edit  ]   \n There are two quantifiers, the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is \"\u2200\", an inverted letter \" A \", which stands for \"for all\" or \"all\". The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is \"\u2203\", a rotated letter \" E \", which stands for \"there exists\" or \"exists\". \n An example of quantifying an English statement would be as follows. Given the statement, \"All of Peters friends either like to dance or like to go to the beach\", we can identify key aspects and rewrite using symbols including quantifiers. So, let x be any one particular friend of Peter, X the set of all Peter's friends, P(x) be the  predicate  (mathematical logic) \"x likes to dance\", and lastly Q(x) the predicate \"x likes to go to the beach\". Then we have,\u00a0:  . Which is read, \"for all x that's a member of X, P of x or Q of x.\" \n Some other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, \n \n   \n \n for a formula  P . Variant notations include, for set  X  and set members  x : \n \n   \n \n All of these variations also apply to universal quantification. Other variations for the universal quantifier are \n \n   \n \n Some versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification. The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways: \n \n Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification, as is done in  Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory , \n Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain, which is the  type  of that variable. This is analogous to the situation in  statically typed   computer programming  languages, where variables have declared types. \n Mention explicitly the range of quantification, perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain or the  type  of the objects in that domain. \n \n One can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which  variable capture  does not occur. Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used. \n Informally or in natural language, the \"\u2200 x \" or \"\u2203 x \" might appear after or in the middle of  P ( x ). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front. \n Mathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers, with natural language quantifiers such as \n \n For any natural number  x , .... \n There exists an  x  such that .... \n For at least one  x . \n \n Keywords for  uniqueness quantification  include: \n \n For exactly one natural number  x , .... \n There is one and only one  x  such that .... \n \n Further,  x  may be replaced by a  pronoun . For example, \n \n For any natural number, its product with 2 equals to its sum with itself \n Some natural number is prime. \n \n  Equivalent expressions   [  edit  ]   \n If  X  is a domain of  x  and  P ( x ) is a predicate dependent on  x , then the universal proposition is expressed in  Boolean algebra  terms as  \n \n   \n \n which equivalently reads \"if  x  is in  X , then  P ( x ) is true.\" If  x  is not in  X , then  P ( x ) is indeterminate. Note that the truth of the expression requires only that  x  be in  X , so it can be  any x  in  X , independent of  P ( x ), whereas the  falsity  of the expression, or the truth of \n \n   \n \n additionally requires that  x  be such that  P ( x ) evaluates to false; this is the reason behind calling  x  a \"bound variable.\" This last expression can thus be read as \"for some  x  in  X ,  P ( x ) is false,\" or \"there exists an  x  in  X  such that  P ( x ) is false.\" So, we now have the equivalent Boolean expression for the existential proposition:  \n \n   \n \n Thus, together with negation, only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks: \n \n   \n \n which shows that to disprove a \"for all  x \" proposition, one needs no more than to find an  x  for which the predicate is false. Similarly,  \n \n   \n \n to disprove a \"there exists an  x \" proposition, one needs to show that the predicate is false for all  x . \n  Nesting   [  edit  ]   \n Consider the following statement: \n \n For any natural number  , there is a natural number   such that  . \n \n This is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the quantifiers are turned around is different: \n \n There is a natural number   such that for any natural number  ,  . \n \n This is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number  s  that is at once the square of  every  natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any newly introduced variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables. \n This illustrates that the order of quantifiers is critical to meaning. \n A less trivial example is the important concept of  uniform continuity  from  analysis , which differs from the more familiar concept of  pointwise continuity  only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers. To illustrate this, let  f  be a real-valued function on  R . \n \n A: Pointwise continuity of   on  R : \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n interchanging the universal quantifiers over the braces, this is the same as \n \n A': Pointwise continuity of  f  on  R : \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n Thus, it is implied that the particular value chosen for  \u03b4  can only be a function of  \u03b5  and  x , the variables that precede it; whereas in \n \n B: Uniform continuity of  f  on  R : \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n by interchanging the existential and universal quantifiers over the braces in A',  \u03b4  is asserted to be independent of  x . \n Ambiguity is avoided with the quantifiers in front: \n \n   A:  B: C \u2013 unambiguous \n there is an A such that   B: C \u2013 unambiguous \n there is an A such that for all B, C \u2013 unambiguous, provided that the separation between B and C is clear \n there is an A such that C for all B \u2013 it is often clear that what is meant is \n \n \n \n \n there is an A such that (C for all B) \n \n \n but it could be interpreted as\n \n (there is an A such that C) for all B \n \n \n \n \n there is an A such that C   B \u2014 suggests more strongly that the first is meant; this may be reinforced by the layout, for example by putting \"C   B\" on a new line. \n \n The maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers inside a formula is called its  Quantifier rank . \n  Range of quantification   [  edit  ]   \n Every quantification involves one specific variable and a  domain of discourse  or  range of quantification  of that variable. The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes. In the examples above, the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers. Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between, asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some  real number . Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as \" n \" for natural numbers and \" x \" for real numbers, although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument. \n A more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses  guarded quantification . For example, the guarded quantification \n \n For some natural number  n ,  n  is even and  n  is prime \n \n means \n \n For some  even number   n ,  n  is prime. \n \n In some mathematical theories a single domain of discourse fixed in advance is assumed. For example, in  Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory , variables range over all sets. In this case, guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification. Thus in the example above to express \n \n For any natural number  n ,  n \u00b72 =  n  +  n  \n \n in Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, it can be said \n \n For any  n , if  n  belongs to  N , then  n \u00b72 =  n  +  n , \n \n where  N  is the set of all natural numbers. \n  Formal semantics   [  edit  ]   \n Mathematical Semantics is the application of  mathematics  to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language. It has three elements: A mathematical specification of a class of objects via  syntax , a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two, which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones. This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted. \n Given a  model theoretical  logical framework, the syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree. Quantifiers have scope and a variable  x  is  free  if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable. Thus in \n \n   \n \n the occurrence of both  x  and  y  in  C ( y , x ) is free. \n \n    \n \n     \nSyntactic tree illustrating scope and variable capture \n \n \n An interpretation for first-order predicate calculus assumes as given a domain of individuals  X . A formula  A  whose free variables are  x  1 , ...,  x  n  is interpreted as a  boolean -valued function  F ( v  1 , ...,  v   n  ) of  n  arguments, where each argument ranges over the domain  X . Boolean-valued means that the function assumes one of the values  T  (interpreted as truth) or  F  (interpreted as falsehood). The interpretation of the formula \n \n   \n \n is the function  G  of  n -1 arguments such that  G ( v  1 , ..., v   n -1 ) =  T  if and only if  F ( v  1 , ...,  v   n -1 ,  w ) =  T  for every  w  in  X . If  F ( v  1 , ...,  v   n -1 ,  w ) =  F  for at least one value of  w , then  G ( v  1 , ..., v   n -1 ) =  F . Similarly the interpretation of the formula \n \n   \n \n is the function  H  of  n -1 arguments such that  H ( v  1 , ..., v   n -1 ) =  T  if and only if  F ( v  1 , ..., v   n -1 ,  w ) =  T  for at least one  w  and  H ( v  1 , ...,  v   n -1 ) =  F  otherwise. \n The semantics for  uniqueness quantification  requires first-order predicate calculus with equality. This means there is given a distinguished two-placed predicate \"=\"; the semantics is also modified accordingly so that \"=\" is always interpreted as the two-place equality relation on  X . The interpretation of \n \n   \n \n then is the function of  n -1 arguments, which is the logical  and  of the interpretations of \n \n   \n   \n \n  Paucal, multal and other degree quantifiers   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  Fubini's theorem \u00a0and  measurable  \n None of the quantifiers previously discussed apply to a quantification such as \n \n There are many integers  n  &lt; 100, such that  n  is divisible by 2 or 3 or 5. \n \n One possible interpretation mechanism can be obtained as follows: Suppose that in addition to a semantic domain  X , we have given a  probability measure  P defined on  X  and cutoff numbers 0 &lt;  a  \u2264  b  \u2264 1. If  A  is a formula with free variables  x  1 ,..., x   n   whose interpretation is the function  F  of variables  v  1 ,..., v   n   then the interpretation of \n \n   \n \n is the function of  v  1 ,..., v   n -1  which is  T  if and only if \n \n   \n \n and  F  otherwise. Similarly, the interpretation of \n \n   \n \n is the function of  v  1 ,..., v   n -1  which is  F  if and only if \n \n   \n \n and  T  otherwise. \n  Other quantifiers   [  edit  ]   \n A few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. In particular, the solution quantifier,   [ 1 ]    noted \u00a7 ( section sign ) and read \"those\". For example: \n \n   \n \n is read \"those  n  in  N  such that  n  2  \u2264 4 are in {0,1,2}.\" The same construct is expressible in  set-builder notation : \n \n   \n \n  History   [  edit  ]   \n  Term logic  treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis.  Aristotelian logic  treated  All ,  Some  and  No  in the 1st century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities. \n  Gottlob Frege , in his 1879   Begriffsschrift  , was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a  domain of discourse  and appearing in  predicates . He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~\u2200 x ~, or  contraposition . Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until  Bertrand Russell 's 1903  Principles of Mathematics . \n In work that culminated in Peirce (1885),  Charles Sanders Peirce  and his student  Oscar Howard Mitchell  independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and  bound variables . Peirce and Mitchell wrote \u03a0 x  and \u03a3 x  where we now write \u2200 x  and \u2203 x . Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of  Ernst Schr\u00f6der ,  Leopold Loewenheim ,  Thoralf Skolem , and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of  Kurt G\u00f6del 's landmark 1930 paper on the  completeness  of  first-order logic , and 1931 paper on the  incompleteness  of  Peano arithmetic . \n Peirce's approach to quantification also influenced  William Ernest Johnson  and  Giuseppe Peano , who invented yet another notation, namely ( x ) for the universal quantification of  x  and (in 1897) \u2203 x  for the existential quantification of  x . Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was ( x ) P  to express \"all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property  P ,\" and \"(\u2203 x ) P \" for \"there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property  P .\" Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. Peano's notation was adopted by the   Principia Mathematica   of  Whitehead  and  Russell ,  Quine , and  Alonzo Church . In 1935,  Gentzen  introduced the \u2200 symbol, by analogy with Peano's \u2203 symbol. \u2200 did not become canonical until the 1960s. \n Around 1895, Peirce began developing his  existential graphs , whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified. Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable's quantification is universal or existential. (Shallowness is the contrary of depth, which is determined by the nesting of negations.) Peirce's graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching  heterogeneous reasoning  and  diagrammatic inference . \n  Natural science   [  edit  ]   \n Some measure of the undisputed general importance of quantification in the  natural sciences  can be gleaned from the following comments: \"these are mere facts, but they are quantitative facts and the basis of science.\"   [ 2 ]    It seems to be held as universally true that \"the foundation of quantification is measurement.\"   [ 3 ]    There is little doubt that \"quantification provided a basis for the objectivity of science.\"   [ 4 ]    [The context of these quotes is slightly misleading - most scientists use quantification as related to quantities, which is categorically different than quantifier as used in this article. Most would probably article that the word is Qualifier.] In ancient times, \"musicians and artists...rejected quantification, but merchants, by definition, quantified their affairs, in order to survive, made them visible on parchment and paper.\"   [ 5 ]    Any reasonable \"comparison between Aristotle and Galileo shows clearly that there can be no unique lawfulness discovered without detailed quantification.\"   [ 6 ]    Even today, \"universities use imperfect instruments called ' exams ' to indirectly quantify something they call knowledge.\"   [ 7 ]    This meaning of quantification comes under the heading of  pragmatics . \n In some instances in the natural sciences a seemingly intangible concept may be quantified by creating a scale\u2014for example, a  pain scale  in medical research, or a discomfort scale at the intersection of  meteorology  and  human physiology  such as the  heat index  measuring the combined perceived effect of heat and  humidity , or the  wind chill factor  measuring the combined perceived effects of cold and wind. \n  Social sciences   [  edit  ]   \n See also:  Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior \u00a0and  Quantitative psychological research  \n In the  social sciences , quantification is an integral part of  economics  and  psychology . Both disciplines gather data\u2014economics by  empirical observation  and psychology by  experimentation , and both use  statistical techniques  such as  regression analysis  to draw conclusions from it. \n In some instances a seemingly intangible property may be quantified by asking subjects to rate something on a  scale \u2014for example, a  happiness scale  or a  quality of life scale \u2014or by the construction of a scale by the researcher, as with the  index of economic freedom . In other cases, an unobservable variable may be quantified by replacing it with a  proxy variable  with which it is highly correlated\u2014for example, per capita  gross domestic product  is often used as a proxy for  standard of living  or  quality of life . \n Frequently in the use of regression, the presence or absence of a trait is quantified by employing a  dummy variable , which takes on the value 1 in the presence of the trait or the value 0 in the absence of the trait. \n  Quantitative linguistics  is an area of  linguistics  that relies on quantification. For example,   [ 8 ]    indices of  grammaticalization  of  morphemes , such as  phonological  shortness, dependence on surroundings, and fusion with the verb, have been developed and found to be significantly correlated across languages with stage of evolution of function of the morpheme. \n  Hard versus soft science   [  edit  ]   \n The ease of quantification is one of the features used to distinguish  hard and soft sciences  from each other. Hard sciences are often considered to be more scientific, rigorous, or accurate. In some  social sciences  such as  sociology , specific accurate data are difficult to obtain, either because laboratory conditions are not present or because the issues involved are conceptual but not directly quantifiable.
